## **Learning with AI Tutor

**Overview of AI-Powered Learning Workflow**

This workflow aims to demonstrate a comprehensive and AI-driven way to learn new skills using freely available tools and techniques. The steps covered include building a custom AI tutor, integrating voice interaction for personalized learning, and creating a knowledge library that can generate audio podcasts to reinforce learning. Below, you'll find an overview of each major step, including how-to instructions, relevant code or prompts to replicate this process, and the tools and websites referenced.

### Step 1: Building a Custom AI Tutor

In this step, you will create a personalized AI tutor tailored to your specific needs and interests. This can be done using any large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, Claude, or other alternatives. The process involves using a pre-configured prompt to generate a tutor who can interact with you based on your requirements.

#### How to Build the Custom Tutor:

1. **Access the LLM**: Go to ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com) or any LLM platform like Claude (https://claude.ai).
2. **Input the GPT Builder Prompt**:

    - Copy the custom GPT Builder prompt provided in the article linked in the video description.
    - Paste this prompt into a new chat window. This will initiate the building of your custom AI tutor.

3. **Configure Variables**:

    - You need to specify the subject you want to learn (e.g., Python programming).
    - Set the target audience's age for a customized explanation level (e.g., 18 years).

4. **Customize Tutor Style**:

    - You can choose whether the tutor should be a patient mentor, a problem-solving partner, or a mix of both.
    - To skip detailed customization, simply type **"Auto"** to let the system fill in these details automatically.

#### Example Prompt to Build Tutor:

```
I want this GPT to be a customized tutor specifically designed to help the user with learning Python.
The user is 18 years old.
Tutor style: Patient Mentor.
```

After the prompt is submitted, the AI generates a custom tutor profile with a name, description, and even a profile picture. You can save these and use them as a reference for your new learning assistant.

### Step 2: Using Voice Interaction for Learning

In this step, you enhance the interaction by enabling advanced voice modes for hands-free communication with your AI tutor. This allows you to speak directly to your tutor, making the learning process more dynamic and engaging.

#### How to Enable Voice Interaction:

1. **Set Up Custom Instructions**:

    - Take the generated system prompt from your AI tutor and add it to the **Custom Instructions** section of ChatGPT or another AI.

2. **Activate Voice Mode**:

    - If using ChatGPT, switch to voice mode by tapping the microphone icon on your device.

3. **Voice Interaction**:

    - Use voice commands to communicate with your tutor. For instance, say, "Help me learn Selenium for Python."
    - Your tutor will respond with detailed instructions, examples, and even provide coding help.

#### Example Voice Interaction:

- **User**: "What's up?"
- **AI Tutor**: "Hey there, how's it going? I'm just here to help you learn Selenium, a powerful tool for automating web browsers."

This interaction style helps learners engage naturally without constantly typing commands.

### Step 3: Creating a Knowledge Library and Generating Podcasts

Once you've used the tutor to learn a topic, the next step is to curate what you've learned into a reusable format. This is done using **Notebook LM** (a free tool from Google: https://notebooklm.google.com), which can compile all your sources, such as chats, PDFs, and website links, into one organized place.

#### How to Build a Knowledge Library:

1. **Collect Sources**:

    - Copy the entire conversation from your tutor, including the questions and coding examples.
    - Paste this into **Notebook LM** as a source.
    - Add other resources like YouTube links, PDFs, or notes from textbooks.

2. **Generate a Learning Podcast**:

    - Use Notebook LM's **audio overview** feature to convert your sources into an interactive podcast.
    - This podcast will simulate a conversation between two AIs summarizing the key concepts you’ve learned.

3. **Listen to Reinforce Learning**:

    - Download the podcast and listen to it while commuting, walking, or relaxing. This helps reinforce the concepts you’ve just learned and keeps them fresh in your mind.

#### Example of Podcast Use:

- The AI-generated podcast might start with, "Today we're diving into Python web scraping using Selenium. It's like having a secret decoder ring for the internet!"
- Listening to these conversations helps to re-engage with the material without needing to read through lengthy text again.

### Bonus Step: Using the 'Highlight' Tool

In addition to the above steps, the 'Highlight' tool is introduced as a contextual assistant that integrates with your workflow, such as reading articles, emails, or messages.

#### How to Use Highlight:

1. **Install and Set Up Highlight**: Install the Highlight app from their website (https://highlight.com), grant the required permissions, and it will appear as a floating interface on your screen.
2. **Use Contextual Prompts**: Highlight integrates directly with content on your screen, such as web pages or documents. You can use predefined prompts or create custom actions to enhance productivity.
3. **Automated Assistance**: Use Highlight for tasks like live fact-checking, summarizing articles, or even integrating with Google Calendar and Notion.

Highlight enhances your productivity by understanding the context in which you are working and providing relevant support without needing you to manually input everything.

### Summary

This AI-powered learning workflow leverages multiple free tools to create a complete cycle of learning, reinforcement, and re-engagement:

- **Custom AI Tutor**: Personalized guidance using LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).
- **Voice Interaction**: Dynamic, hands-free interaction for a more natural learning experience.
- **Notebook LM for Podcasts**: Reinforce knowledge through AI-generated podcasts, using sources like chats, PDFs, and YouTube links.
- **Highlight**: Contextual assistance to integrate learning into daily tasks (e.g., summarizing articles, providing instant support).

These tools together create a powerful way to learn new skills, enhance understanding, and continuously refresh knowledge in an engaging and accessible manner.
