# AI Roadmap based on Stanford AI Graduate Certificate

**EXA AI Roadmap (Based on Stanford AI Graduate Certificate Program)**

Master the concepts and skills of the Stanford AI Graduate Certificate program, entirely for FREE! Our curated guide offers a structured path to AI excellence, tailored to your individual pace.

While most students complete the Stanford AI Graduate Certificate program in 1-2 years when studying part-time, self-study can take significantly longer. The amount of time it takes depends on various factors, including:

- **Your experience level**: If you have a strong foundation in math, programming, and related fields, you may be able to progress faster.
- **Your dedication and time commitment**: The more time you devote to studying, the quicker you can complete the program.
- **The depth of your learning**: If you want to gain a deep understanding of each topic, you may need to spend more time.

It's important to set realistic expectations and be patient with yourself. Remember, the goal is to learn and understand the material, not just to finish the program quickly.
