## **The way math should be taught

### **Reframing Math as Art: A Detailed Exploration**

Mathematics is often perceived as boring, hard, and elitist. However, this narrative challenges those stereotypes, presenting math as fun, creative, and accessible, depending on how it's approached. Here's an exploration of key ideas, philosophies, and practices aimed at reshaping how math is taught and learned.

### **Math as Art**

- **The Common Perception:** Math is frequently seen as dry and unapproachable. But what if it were taught as an art? Instead of rigid formulas and right answers, math could become a medium of exploration and creativity.
- **The Artistic Approach:** Inspired by Paul Lockhart's essay *The Mathematician's Lament*, the idea is to teach math like art classes: focusing on techniques, exploration, and personal interpretation rather than definitive answers.

### **Paul Lockhart’s Vision**

1. **The Mathematician's Lament:**
   - Advocates for playful exploration in math education.
   - Critiques traditional approaches for stifling creativity and curiosity.
   - Suggests that students would love math if it were taught as an imaginative and exploratory subject.

2. **Measurement (Book):**
   - Extends the ideas of *The Mathematician's Lament* with practical examples and problems.
   - Demonstrates the joy of discovery in geometry, algebra, and calculus.
   - Frames math as an intuitive, imaginative, and personal pursuit.

### **The Joy of Mathematical Problems**

- **Math as Exploration:**
  - Problems are opportunities to explore mathematical reality and uncover its hidden behaviors.
  - The focus is on understanding *why* things are the way they are through proofs, not just finding numerical answers.
- **Proof as a Story:**
  - Mathematical proofs are narratives where the solver crafts the plot using the elements of a problem as characters.
  - This storytelling approach makes math more engaging and personal.

### **An Example Problem: The Pentagon**

- **Problem Statement:** How can we measure the diagonals of a pentagon?
  - **Process:** By identifying patterns, symmetry, and relationships (e.g., similar triangles), the problem evolves as a creative exploration.
  - **Golden Ratio:** The solution reveals the golden ratio (~1.618), showcasing the deep connections between geometry and natural patterns.
- **The Role of Algebra:**
  - Algebra helps untangle relationships and provide insights into mathematical structures.
  - It’s presented as a tool for artistic manipulation, dating back to ancient Babylonian techniques.

### **Learning and Teaching Philosophy**

- **Student-Centered Learning:**
  - True mathematical learning happens when students actively engage with problems and discover their own solutions.
  - Teachers should facilitate curiosity and creativity rather than impose rigid methods.
- **Creating Personal Problems:**
  - Students are encouraged to invent their own problems, fostering deeper engagement.
  - Grappling with multiple, long-term problems builds resilience and insight.

### **Math as a Lifelong Journey**

- **Long-Term Engagement:**
  - Problems can accompany learners for years, offering new insights as they revisit them over time.
  - This approach mirrors the creative process in art or storytelling.
- **An Abstract Escape:**
  - Math is compared to reading a fantasy novel—a retreat into an abstract world, free from the constraints of reality.
  - The abstract nature of math makes it intrinsically rewarding, regardless of its practical applications.

### **Conclusion**

Mathematics, when reframed as a creative and exploratory pursuit, becomes a powerful medium for self-expression and intellectual growth. By shifting the focus from rote memorization and utility to curiosity and play, learners can unlock the true joy of math. The journey lies not in finding answers but in discovering the beauty and logic of the process itself.

This perspective invites learners to:

1. Embrace math as an art form.
2. Engage with problems imaginatively.
3. Create personal narratives through proofs.
4. Find joy in the abstract and the unknown.

In the words of Paul Lockhart, mathematics is “to be enjoyed.” Let it be a source of wonder and discovery for all who approach it with an open mind.
