## **Absorb More Faster

The speaker, Salim, a medical student, shares a "triforce method" to dramatically improve reading speed, aiming to help people read books quickly without spending excessive time. This method includes three main strategies:

1. **Improve Baseline Reading Speed**: Remove your internal monologue when reading using tools like Spreeder to help visually process words rather than "hearing" them, which increases reading speed. Also, use a visual tracker like a pen to smoothen eye movement and prevent backtracking, further enhancing speed.
2. **Adopt a Reading Strategy**: Apply the 80/20 rule, focusing on the 20% of content that provides 80% of the value, particularly for non-fiction books. Adjust your reading speed to absorb key information more effectively.
3. **Summarize and Consolidate**: To retain what you read, summarize each page in one or two lines to boost comprehension and actively engage with the material. For non-fiction, take action on key points to ensure real learning.

The method emphasizes efficiency in reading while ensuring comprehension and application.
