# **Theories of [[Consciousness]]**

Theories of consciousness aim to explain how and why we experience awareness, thoughts, and surroundings. These theories span [[Neuroscience]], [[Philosophy]], and [[Cognitive Science]], each offering different perspectives on what consciousness is and how it arises.

### **1. Dualism (Mind-Body Dualism)**

- **Proponent**: René Descartes
- **Overview**: The mind and body are distinct entities, with consciousness residing in the non-physical mind.
- **Criticism**: Difficult to reconcile with modern neuroscience.

### **2. Materialism (Physicalism)**

- **Overview**: Consciousness is a product of physical brain processes.
- **Criticism**: Faces the "hard problem" of explaining subjective experience (qualia).

### **3. Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**

- **Proponent**: Bernard Baars
- **Overview**: Consciousness is like a "spotlight" that broadcasts information to different brain areas.
- **Criticism**: Doesn't address the subjective nature of experience.

### **4. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**

- **Proponent**: Giulio Tononi
- **Overview**: Consciousness is the integration of information in a system.
- **Criticism**: Complex and difficult to test.

### **5. Higher-Order Theories (HOT)**

- **Overview**: Consciousness occurs when a mental state is the object of another, higher-order state.
- **Criticism**: Doesn't fully solve the "hard problem" of consciousness.

### **6. Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)**

- **Proponents**: Roger Penrose, Stuart Hameroff
- **Overview**: Consciousness arises from quantum processes in the brain’s microtubules.
- **Criticism**: Lacks empirical support and is highly speculative.

### **7. Panpsychism**

- **Overview**: Consciousness is a fundamental property of all matter.
- **Criticism**: Faces the "combination problem" of how simple consciousness units form human experience.

### **8. Attention Schema Theory (AST)**

- **Proponent**: Michael Graziano
- **Overview**: Consciousness is the brain's model of its attention processes.
- **Criticism**: Lacks a solution for the subjective nature of experience.

### **9. Enactivism and Embodied Cognition**

- **Overview**: Consciousness arises from interactions between an organism and its environment.
- **Criticism**: May downplay the brain’s role in consciousness.
