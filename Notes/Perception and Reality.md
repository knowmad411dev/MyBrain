## **[[Perception]] and [[Reality]]

Our brain actively interprets sensory input, creating a subjective version of reality. Optical illusions and cultural differences reveal how malleable our perception is.

"Perception and Reality" often explores how our senses shape our understanding of the world. Our perceptions are influenced by our brain's processing of sensory inputs, meaning that what we perceive is a constructed version of reality rather than an objective truth. Cognitive biases, expectations, and past experiences shape how we see and interpret things, leading to variations in how each individual understands reality.
