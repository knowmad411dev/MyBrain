## **Building Custom AI Tools Using GPT Bot Builder

#### Overview

The video demonstrates how to quickly go from being an AI novice to a pro by building custom AI tools using the GPT Bot Builder. The creator, Shane Fard, introduces the concept of creating custom AI tools to help solve business problems, such as generating social media posts, writing emails, or creating content strategies, using OpenAI's GPT capabilities.

#### Key Concepts and Tools

1. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** GPT is a tool developed by OpenAI that allows you to create a sequence of tasks or workflows that can be repeatedly used for different purposes. The video focuses on creating a specialized GPT called the "GPT Bot Builder" that helps users create their own GPTs efficiently.
2. **Applications of Custom GPTs:**

    - **Social Media Post Creator**
    - **Ad Copywriter**
    - **Video Script Generator**
    - **Email Responder**
    - **SEO Article Writer**
    - **Digital Brain Creator**
    - **Brand Voice Creator**
    - **Comic Book Image Generator**

3. **The Ultimate GPT Bot Builder GPT:**

    - The "GPT Bot Builder GPT" is designed to help users build custom GPTs in about 60 seconds.
    - It provides two options:

        1. **Use Pre-built GPTs:** Simply use the provided tools to start generating custom workflows.
        2. **Create Custom GPTs:** Use the provided code and instructions to modify and build your own GPT bots.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions to Create a GPT Bot

1. **Get the GPT Bot Builder Code:**

    - The video provides a link to the code and instructions to build the GPT Bot. The user can download and modify this as needed.

2. **Create a Custom GPT Example:**

    - Example: Create a 7-day social media content strategy.
    - Type a command in the GPT Bot Builder to generate the GPT for a specific task.
    - If it misses a command, use "See previous message" to remind the bot.
    - Review the generated tasks and steps, removing unnecessary ones or adding your own.

3. **Output the GPT Instructions:**

    - Once complete, the bot will display instructions in a code box for easy copying.
    - **Copy the Code.**

4. **Create a New GPT in OpenAI:**

    - Navigate to **Explore GPTs** in the OpenAI interface.
    - Click **Create**, and then paste the copied code into the instruction window.
    - **Pro Tip:** Use the phrase, “Give me a list of numbered options to choose from to get started,” as a conversation starter for your GPT. This helps streamline user interaction by offering selectable options.
    - Upload any **Knowledge Files** relevant to the task. (A deeper dive into Knowledge Files is promised in a future video.)

5. **Adjust Settings and Finalize GPT:**

    - Disable the DALL-E 3 option (image creation) if your GPT does not need to generate images.
    - Provide a name, select an icon, or upload a custom image.
    - **Create and Run the GPT.**

#### Understanding the GPT Bot Builder’s Structure

The bot builder uses a template structure that can be replicated for creating custom GPT bots. Key components include:

1. **Role and Description:**

    - Define the purpose and expertise of the GPT.

2. **Rules:**

    - Set global rules for how the GPT functions.
    - Rules may include single-question prompts to avoid overwhelming the user, single-keystroke responses for ease, and providing a "help" option for assistance.

3. **Context:**

    - Provide background information to clarify any ambiguity in the bot’s tasks (e.g., understanding multiple meanings of GPT).

4. **Instructions - Tasks and Steps:**

    - Define **Tasks**: High-level goals for the GPT.
    - Define **Steps**: Specific actions needed to achieve each task.
    - Common tasks include defining outcomes, confirming the role and structure, reviewing relevant knowledge files, and compiling the final instructions.

5. **Example Structure:**

    - The example structure is included as part of the instructions, allowing for easy replication and customization.

#### Final Tips and Links

- Users are encouraged to explore and use the GPT Bot Builder to automate business processes and create AI tools swiftly.
- For further support and detailed guidance, links to the swipe files (code and instructions) are provided in the video description.

#### Code and Resources

- **Swipe Files and Code Repository:** Links to the provided code for the GPT Bot Builder are in the video description. Users are instructed to download, modify, and use these to create custom GPT bots.

#### Video Engagement and Call to Action

- **Engage with Content:** Viewers are encouraged to like, subscribe, and hit the notification bell to get updates on future videos about AI tools and strategies to optimize business processes.

#### Final Notes

This video serves as both an instructional guide and a resource to empower users in building AI tools efficiently and without much prior expertise. By following the instructions, users can quickly set up AI-based workflows tailored to their business needs.

### Template for a GPT Bot Builder (Python-based example)

This template uses OpenAI's Python API to build a basic GPT bot structure. Make sure you have `openai` installed:

```
pip install openai
```

Then, use the following code to set up a bot:

```Python
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API Key (Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual API key)
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

# Define the prompt for the GPT bot
def create_gpt_bot(prompt, instructions):
    """
    Creates a custom GPT bot with the provided prompt and instructions.

    :param prompt: The primary task or function the GPT bot will perform.
    :param instructions: A series of structured rules and steps for the bot.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"{prompt}\n\nInstructions:\n{instructions}",
        max_tokens=500,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example Prompt and Instructions for the GPT Bot Builder
prompt = "You are a custom GPT Bot Builder designed to help users create their own AI bots."
instructions = """
Roles:
- Your role is to generate structured tasks for creating AI tools based on user needs.

Rules:
1. Ask one question at a time to avoid overwhelming the user.
2. Offer single-keystroke responses (e.g., Y/N) for simplicity.
3. Provide a "Help" option if the user requires more assistance.
4. Ensure clarity in all instructions to the user.

Context:
- Understand that 'GPT' can mean both 'Generative Pre-trained Transformer' and 'custom GPT bot'.
- Follow a systematic approach to help the user outline their AI tool.

Tasks and Steps:
Task 1: Define the AI tool's primary goal.
    Step 1.1: Ask the user what problem they are trying to solve.
    Step 1.2: Clarify any ambiguities in their problem statement.

Task 2: Confirm the AI tool's structure and function.
    Step 2.1: Ask the user for examples of input and expected output.
    Step 2.2: Confirm whether the tool will generate text, analyze data, or assist in another function.

Task 3: Provide customization options.
    Step 3.1: Ask if the user requires any specific tone or language style.
    Step 3.2: Offer additional features like image generation or data analysis.

Task 4: Compile final instructions.
    Step 4.1: Summarize the AI tool's capabilities.
    Step 4.2: Generate the code template for the custom GPT.

Example:
- AI Bot: "Creating a social media post generator for small business promotions."
"""

# Create the GPT bot
bot_response = create_gpt_bot(prompt, instructions)

print("Generated GPT Bot Instructions:")
print(bot_response)
```

### Key Parts of the Code

1. `**prompt**` **and** `**instructions**`**:** These define the purpose and rules of the custom GPT bot. The structure is laid out clearly:

    - **Roles:** Outline what the bot should do.
    - **Rules:** Specify interaction protocols (e.g., single-question prompts).
    - **Tasks and Steps:** Break down the bot creation into clear, actionable tasks and sub-steps.

2. `**openai.Completion.create**`**:** This method makes a request to OpenAI's API to generate text based on the prompt and instructions.
3. **Example Structure:** The example section provides a basic use case to guide the bot in generating its tasks.

### Important Notes:

- You need to replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.
- Modify `prompt` and `instructions` to fit the specific AI bot you are trying to build.
