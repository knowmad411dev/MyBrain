## **Fundamental Attribution Error

### **Definition**:

The Fundamental Attribution Error is the [[Cognitive Bias]] of attributing someone else's actions to their character or personality, while underestimating external situational factors that may have influenced their behavior.

### **Related Biases**:

- **Actor-Observer Bias**: The tendency to attribute your own actions to external circumstances but attribute others' actions to their personal traits.
- **Self-Serving Bias**: Attributing your successes to internal factors (like skill) and failures to external factors (like luck).
- **Halo Effect**: The tendency to let an overall positive impression of someone influence judgments about their specific traits or behaviors.

### **Key Concept**:

This bias leads people to overemphasize personality-based explanations for others' behaviors while underemphasizing situational influences.

### **Example**:

If someone cuts you off in traffic, you might assume they are a rude person, rather than considering they might be in a hurry due to an emergency.

### **Related Concepts**:
