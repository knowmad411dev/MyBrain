### **[[Artificial intelligence]] and [[Knowledge Representation]]**

This field involves designing AI systems that mimic human [[Cognition]] by representing [[Knowledge]] logically for reasoning and decision-making.

### **Purpose**

- Develop systems that can store, organize, and apply knowledge.
- Enable AI to reason and make decisions autonomously.
- Bridge human and [[Machine learning]] processes.

### **Examples**

- **[[Knowledge Graphs]]**: Structures that connect related data.
- **[[Ontology]] in AI**: Define concepts and relationships within domains.
- **[[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP)**: Enables AI to understand human language.

### **Use Case**

- **Search Engines**: Use AI to retrieve relevant information efficiently.
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Apply structured knowledge to assist users.
- **PKM Systems**: Integrate AI tools for automated knowledge management.

### **Related Concepts**

- **[[Knowledge Graph]]**: Visualizes relationships between ideas.
- **[[Epistemology]]**: Investigates how machines "know" things.
- **[[Machine learning]]**: Uses data to improve AI performance.
