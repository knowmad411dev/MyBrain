## **Artificial Intelligence Stages**

### **1. Rule-based AI**

- **Definition**: Basic AI that follows predefined rules, often using "if-then" logic.
- **Characteristics**: Works best in environments with clear, unchanging rules.
- **Limitations**: Inflexible, cannot learn or adapt to new situations without human intervention.

### **2. Context-based AI**

- **Definition**: AI that incorporates situational context in decision-making.
- **Characteristics**: Uses NLP and machine learning for more natural and intuitive interactions.
- **Examples**: Virtual assistants (e.g., Alexa), healthcare diagnostics (e.g., IBM Watson Health).

### **3. Domain-specific AI**

- **Definition**: AI systems specialized in specific fields, combining deep knowledge with machine learning.
- **Characteristics**: Perform tasks requiring human expertise in a particular area.

### **4. [[Thinking]] and Reasoning AI**

- **Definition**: AI mimicking human cognitive processes, engaging in abstract problem-solving and decision-making.
- **Examples**: DeepMind's AlphaGo, OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Capabilities**: Handles ambiguity, incomplete information, and demonstrates creativity.

### **5. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**

- **Definition**: AI that matches or surpasses human intelligence across a wide range of tasks.
- **Characteristics**: Autonomous, flexible, can transfer knowledge and learn new skills rapidly.

### **6. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)**

- **Definition**: AI that far surpasses human intelligence in all domains.
- **Implications**: Unprecedented problem-solving capabilities, potential risks, and ethical concerns.

### **7. Self-aware AI**

- **Definition**: AI systems with [[Consciousness]], [[Self-Awareness]], and potentially emotions.
- **Ethical Questions**: Discussions around AI rights, autonomy, and the need for legal frameworks.
