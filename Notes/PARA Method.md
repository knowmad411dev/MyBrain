# PARA Method

The **PARA Method** is a system for organizing digital information, developed by **Tiago Forte**. It divides content into four categories—**Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, and **Archives**—to help users efficiently manage their notes, tasks, and files.

## Key Categories of the PARA Method

1. **Projects**: Active tasks with a clear goal or deadline.

    - Example: "Build AI home system."
2. **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities without a defined end date.

    - Example: "Health" or "Home Automation."
3. **Resources**: Reference materials for future use, often related to interests or skill-building.

    - Example: "AI Research Papers" or "Obsidian Tips."
4. **Archives**: Inactive items that are no longer needed but may be referenced later.

    - Example: Completed projects or past resources.

## Purpose of the PARA Method

- **Organize Information**: The PARA method provides a structured framework for managing digital information.
- **Improve Efficiency**: By categorizing content into clear groups, it reduces clutter and makes it easier to access relevant information.
- **Support Long-Term Management**: It allows for continuous organization, helping users track active projects, manage ongoing responsibilities, and store reference materials for later use.

## Example of PARA in Action

When organizing your note-taking system, you might categorize current tasks under **Projects**, such as "Develop AI Home Automation." Meanwhile, your general interests, such as "AI Research," fall under **Resources**, and ongoing efforts like **Health** are stored in **Areas**. Finally, completed projects are moved to **Archives** for future reference.
