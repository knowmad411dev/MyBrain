## Spaced Repetition and Active Recall in Note-Taking

**[[Spaced Repetition]]** and **active recall** are two powerful **learning strategies** that can significantly improve **memory retention** and **long-term understanding** when applied to note-taking. By incorporating these techniques into your [[Note-Taking]] process, you can optimize the way you **review** and **retain** key information.

### **[[Spaced Repetition]]**

**Spaced repetition** is a method of reviewing material at increasing intervals over time to enhance long-term retention. The technique is based on the concept of the "forgetting curve," which shows that memory decays over time unless revisited. By revisiting information at strategically spaced intervals, spaced repetition helps solidify knowledge in long-term memory.

### **[[Active Recall]]**

**Active recall** involves actively retrieving information from memory without looking at your notes, forcing your brain to engage with the material and reinforce connections. It contrasts with passive review, where you simply reread your notes without testing yourself.

### Combining Spaced Repetition and Active Recall in Note-Taking

When combined, **spaced repetition** and **active recall** create a powerful feedback loop that enhances learning and retention. Here's how to integrate these techniques into your note-taking workflow:

1. **Initial Note Creation**: After learning new material, create **atomic notes** that capture single concepts. Add questions or prompts in the margins for active recall.
2. **First Review with Active Recall**: Shortly after creating the note, use the **active recall** technique. Try to answer the questions you added to your notes without looking at them. This engages your memory and reinforces understanding.
3. **Schedule Spaced Reviews**: Use a spaced repetition system to revisit the note at increasing intervals. Each time you review, apply active recall to reinforce the material.
4. **Track Progress**: Use a system like **Anki** or the **Obsidian spaced repetition plugin** to track which notes need review. The software will automatically adjust the intervals based on how well you recall the material.

### Benefits of Spaced Repetition and Active Recall

1. **Enhanced Retention**: Spaced repetition strengthens memory by reviewing information at optimal intervals, while active recall deepens understanding by forcing you to retrieve information from memory.
2. **Improved Learning Efficiency**: These techniques reduce the time spent relearning material by **reinforcing it over time**, making learning more efficient and effective.
3. **Long-Term Knowledge**: Together, spaced repetition and active recall help transfer knowledge from short-term memory to **long-term memory**, ensuring that important concepts stay with you over time.
4. **Better Exam Preparation**: For students, combining these strategies is one of the most effective ways to prepare for exams by continuously testing knowledge and solidifying understanding.

### How to Implement in [[Obsidian]]

- **Spaced Repetition Plugins**: Use **Obsidianâ€™s spaced repetition plugin** to automate review schedules for your notes, ensuring that key concepts are revisited at optimal intervals.
- **Flashcards**: Use **flashcards** within Obsidian or external apps like **Anki** to apply spaced repetition and active recall. Integrate questions into your notes and export them to your flashcard system for testing.
- **[[Contextual Linking]]**: Use **contextual linking** in your notes to connect related ideas. When reviewing one note, use the links to explore other connected topics, which strengthens your overall understanding.
