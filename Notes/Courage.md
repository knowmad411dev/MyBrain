## **Courage

Courage is the ability to face fear, pain, danger, uncertainty, or adversity with resolve and determination. It isn’t the absence of fear but the decision to act despite it. Courage often comes in two forms:

1. **Physical Courage** – confronting physical challenges or threats, like a firefighter entering a burning building.
2. **Moral Courage** – standing up for one's beliefs or values, even when it's unpopular, risky, or uncomfortable. It’s the courage to do what one believes is right, despite fear of criticism or social pressure.

Courage is often seen as the foundation of other virtues because it enables one to act on their values and convictions, even when it’s challenging or when the outcome is uncertain.
