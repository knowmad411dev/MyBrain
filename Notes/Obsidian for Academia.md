## **Obsidian for Academia

**Overview of the Academic Workflow for Obsidian with Pandoc and Zotero Integration**

This text provides an in-depth look at an academic setup using Obsidian, focusing on workflows involving Pandoc and Zotero for reference management and note-taking. The setup is well-suited for students and researchers looking to streamline the export and formatting process of academic notes.

### Key Components of the Workflow

1. **Exporting Notes from Obsidian**: There are two primary ways to export notes from Obsidian:
   - Using **Pandoc**: Provides robust formatting options, including headers, footers, internal links, and academic-style templates.
   - Using the **Native Export Function**: A simpler alternative with fewer features, but capable of preserving an academic format via CSS snippets.

2. **Challenges with Pandoc**: While using Pandoc, certain features like Dataview tables, weak links, and other markdown extensions may not work correctly in the exported document. However, Pandoc offers Lua filters as a workaround for many of these challenges, allowing you to adjust behavior to suit your needs.
3. **Why Use Workarounds?**: Workarounds are emphasized because they often lead to better understanding and a sense of accomplishment. However, it's noted that sometimes the effort may not justify the result, depending on what you're trying to achieve.

### Setup Process

1. **PDF Annotation and Reference Management**
   - The example starts with a **PDF book** (e.g., "Cul and Many Falls" by a specified author).
   - The preferred reference management tool here is **Zotero**. Zotero is highlighted as being highly compatible with Obsidian, allowing easy importing and organizing of references and annotations.

2. **Making Annotations**
   - Annotations are made directly in the PDF using Zotero. These annotations can then be imported into Obsidian as notes.
   - The workflow suggests creating highlights, taking screenshots of key content, and even color-coding annotations by importance.

3. **Importing Annotations into Obsidian**
   - The setup uses a **Zotero-Obsidian integration plugin** to import annotations into Obsidian. The import template allows importing annotations while preserving custom comments.
   - A note is created in Obsidian based on the imported annotations. This note will contain the citation, page numbers, and highlighted comments.

### Writing and Structuring Notes

1. **Creating a New Note for Academic Writing**
   - When starting a new note, use the **academic template** provided in Obsidian, which includes metadata such as author, title, table of contents, etc.
   - The template is designed for flexibility depending on whether you are using Pandoc or the native Obsidian export. It includes all necessary fields like headers, CSS classes, and more, which can be customized as needed.

2. **Managing the Metadata**
   - The metadata includes information like **author name, subtitle, table of contents, and citation style**.
   - The template also provides an optional **two-column format** that can be removed if you prefer a single-column style.

### Citation Management

1. **Manual Citations**
   - You can manually add citations using the **Zotero plugin** in Obsidian. For example, you can select "Add APA Citation" to generate a properly formatted citation from your Zotero library.

2. **Pandoc Citations**
   - Using Pandoc, citations can be added in the format `[[@citekey]]`. The text suggests enabling **Auto Cite Key Suggestion** to streamline the process of adding references.

3. **Generating Bibliographies**
   - Bibliographies can be added manually, using the Zotero plugin, or automatically with Pandoc during the export process. Pandoc can generate a reference list based on all citations in the document, simplifying bibliography management.

### Exporting the Final Document

1. **Exporting with Pandoc**
   - To export with Pandoc, internal links need to be converted to markdown using the **Link Converter Plugin** in Obsidian.
   - You can export as a PDF with Pandoc, including custom headers, footers, and other academic formatting options such as preambles for mathematical content.

2. **Native Obsidian Export**
   - The native export lacks the flexibility of Pandoc, especially for adding headers, footers, or complex page formatting. However, it still produces a clean academic-looking document, suitable for less formal submissions.

### Handling Internal Links

- **Pandoc Limitations**: Internal links do not work well with Pandoc's export process due to the different handling of headers. The suggested workaround is to manually edit headers or use a plugin to manage link conversion.
- **Adding Identifiers**: Headers can be assigned custom identifiers for linking, although this is not recognized by Obsidian by default.

### Encouragement for Community Contribution

The author encourages viewers to contribute to the setup by improving workflows, sharing better solutions, or even contributing code to the repository. Contributions are welcome in the form of **issues, feature requests, or pull requests**.

### Summary

- This setup integrates **Obsidian, Zotero, and Pandoc** for a comprehensive academic workflow.
- **Pandoc** offers powerful formatting and export options but requires some extra effort to make everything work smoothly, such as using Lua filters and converting links.
- **Zotero** is highlighted as the preferred reference manager due to its seamless integration with Obsidian.
- The workflow aims to balance **flexibility and academic formality**, allowing the user to choose between a more manual process and a fully automated one depending on the context.
- **Contributions** to improve the setup are encouraged, focusing on making this academic note-taking system a collaborative and well-rounded tool for all users.
