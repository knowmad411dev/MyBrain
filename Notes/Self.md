### **Definition**:

The **Self** refers to an individual’s awareness of their own [[Identity]], thoughts, [[Emotions]], and experiences. It is a construct that integrates one’s sense of being, shaped by both internal cognition and external interactions.

### **Key Components**:

1. **Self-Concept**: The beliefs and perceptions an individual holds about themselves, including attributes like personality, abilities, and values.
2. **[[Self-Awareness]]**: The conscious recognition of oneself as a distinct entity, capable of reflection and self-examination.
3. **Self-Esteem**: How one values or perceives their own worth and capabilities.
4. **Self-Continuity**: The perception that one remains the same person over time, despite changes in behavior, thoughts, or circumstances.

### **Philosophical Perspectives**:

- **Buddhist View**: The self is an illusion, a constantly changing flow of experiences without a permanent, unchanging core.
- **Cartesian View**: "I think, therefore I am" — self-awareness is fundamental to the existence of the self.
- **Lockean View**: Personal identity is tied to memory and consciousness over time.

### **Psychological Perspectives**:

- **Cognitive Psychology**: Focuses on how self-perception is formed through thought processes, memory, and experiences.
- **Humanistic Psychology**: Emphasizes self-actualization and personal growth as key to understanding the self.

### **Applications**:

- **[[Personal Growth]]**: Understanding the self allows for self-reflection, leading to growth and development.
- **Mental Health**: Self-awareness and self-esteem are central to emotional well-being and psychological health.
- **[[Decision-Making]]**: A strong sense of self helps individuals make decisions aligned with their values and identity.

### **Related Concepts**:
