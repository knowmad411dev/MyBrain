## **[[Problem Solving]]

### **Definition**:

Problem-solving is the process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving issues. It plays a central role in [[Decision-Making]], [[Creativity]], and [[Learning]] across various domains of life.

### **Stages of Problem-Solving**:

1. **Problem Identification**: Recognizing and defining the problem.
2. **Problem Analysis**: Breaking the problem into parts and gathering information.
3. **Generating Solutions**: Brainstorming possible solutions.
4. **Evaluating Solutions**: Assessing and selecting the best option.
5. **Implementation**: Applying the chosen solution.
6. **Monitoring**: Reviewing results and making adjustments if necessary.

### **Types of Problems**:

- **Well-Defined Problems**: Clear goals and solutions (e.g., mathematical problems).
- **Ill-Defined Problems**: Ambiguous goals requiring creativity (e.g., ethical dilemmas).

### **Common Strategies**:

- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures guaranteeing a solution (e.g., math formulas).
- **[[Heuristics]]**: Mental shortcuts for quick problem-solving (e.g., trial and error).
- **Working Backward**: Solving a problem by starting from the goal.
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Using solutions from similar past problems.

### **Barriers to Problem-Solving**:

- **[[Confirmation Bias]]**: Focusing on information that confirms preconceptions.
- **Functional Fixedness**: Limiting an object to its traditional use.
- **Mental Set**: Sticking to familiar strategies, even when they may not work.
- **Overconfidence**: Overestimating one's solution without sufficient analysis.

### **Applications**:

- **Science & Engineering**: Systematic approaches for complex issues.
- **Business**: Strategic decision-making and resource management.
- **Daily Life**: Solving everyday challenges (e.g., conflict resolution).
