# Static Notes

**Static Notes** are fixed pieces of information that remain largely unchanged after being captured. They serve as **reference material** for foundational [[Knowledge]] and are not typically revised or linked to new ideas.

---

## Key Characteristics

- **Documentation**: Static notes preserve **facts**, observations, or summaries for future reference.
- **Minimal Interaction**: Unlike [[Active Notes]], static notes are **rarely updated** or interconnected with other notes. They donâ€™t evolve over time.
- **Supportive Role**: Static notes offer **context** and **background information**, supporting ongoing work but not directly contributing to idea development.

## Difference from Active Notes

- **Static Notes**: Remain fixed and serve as reference material.
- **Active Notes**: Continuously refined, linked, and expanded as new ideas develop.
