# Frontend Image Capture with Webcams

This code is general enough to be applied in any frontend that involves capturing images from a webcam. It's based on JavaScript and can be used in frameworks like React or Next.js.

**General Code Example for Webcam Capture**:
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function WebcamCapture() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);

  const captureImage = async () => {
    const capturedImage = await getWebcamImage(); // getWebcamImage should be defined elsewhere
    setImage(capturedImage);
    await uploadImage(capturedImage); // uploadImage should be defined elsewhere
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={captureImage}>Start Capture</button>
      {image && <img src={image} alt="Captured Background" />}
    </div>
  );
}
```
