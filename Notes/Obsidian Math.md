## **Obsidian Math

Here's a detailed summary of the instructions provided for creating math-focused notes in Obsidian, including plugins, themes, and best practices for managing mathematical content.

---

### Initial Setup and Theme Customization

1. **Enable Math Mode**: Obsidian’s math environment requires manual input for writing formulas. To enhance the experience, start by setting up your appearance and theme.
2. **Change Theme**: Go to **Settings > Appearance** and select a theme, like **Tokyo Night**. Adjust colors to suit your style by modifying the RGB settings as needed.

### Plugins and Shortcuts for Efficient Math Notetaking

1. **Install Latex Suite Plugin**: This plugin provides a variety of LaTeX snippets and commands that make writing equations quicker and easier.
    - **Snippet Trigger**: Use shortcuts like `K` or `DM` to quickly enter math mode, where you can write and edit equations.
2. **Create Custom Snippets**: Define snippets to streamline your workflow.
    - Example: Define variables like `$0`, `$1` to position cursors, allowing quick navigation using the **Tab** key.
    - **Writing Example Snippets**: Insert backticks, cursor placeholders, and other symbols to make snippet creation more seamless.
3. **Vim Mode**: Vim can be activated for fast navigation and editing, though it may have a learning curve for beginners.

### Using Templates for Structured Math Notes

1. **Enable Templates Plugin**: Activate the templates plugin and set up a dedicated folder (e.g., “Templates” in the root folder).
2. **Create Math Templates**:
    - **Sections**: Divide templates into “Idea” and “Formal” sections.
    - **Usage**: Insert templates by pressing **Ctrl + P**, then selecting the appropriate template. This setup enables you to structure explanations and formal math content efficiently.

### Handling Images and Graphical Content

1. **Inserting Graphs and Drawings with Math.io**:
    - Math.io allows for easy graphical representations, including axes and functions.
    - **Exporting**: Export images in SVG format for better resolution and compatibility.
    - **Importing to Obsidian**: Remove background and keep graphics minimalistic for clarity.
2. **Extracting LaTeX from Documents**:
    - Use an AI tool like **SimpleText** to convert mathematical screenshots into LaTeX, streamlining the process of transferring complex formulas into Obsidian.

### Adapting Dark and Light Mode with CSS Snippets

1. **Dynamic Image Color Inversion**:
    - Use a **CSS snippet** to invert colors for better visibility in dark or light modes. Insert and activate this snippet from the CSS folder to achieve adaptive images that automatically match the theme.

### Organizing and Reviewing Notes

1. **Atomic Notes in Canvas**:
    - Organize math notes as atomic notes (single, focused ideas) in Obsidian’s **canvas** format. This layout connects concepts visually and helps deepen understanding.
    - **Review and Connection**: Place connected ideas near each other to create an interactive learning map.

This setup will allow you to create clean, organized, and visually appealing math notes in Obsidian, supporting both formal and graphical representations.
