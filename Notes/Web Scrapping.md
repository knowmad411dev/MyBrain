# Web Scraping

**Web Scraping** is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using software tools or scripts. It involves simulating browsing behavior to gather specific information from web pages, such as text, images, or structured data, for further analysis, storage, or manipulation.

## Key Concepts in Web Scraping

1. **HTML Parsing**: Web scraping tools analyze the HTML structure of a webpage to locate and extract desired elements like titles, links, or text.
2. **Selectors**: Methods like **XPath** or **CSS selectors** are used to precisely pinpoint specific data within the webpage’s HTML code.
3. **Automated Browsers**: Tools like **Selenium** simulate user actions, allowing scripts to interact with dynamic or JavaScript-heavy websites.
4. **APIs**: Some websites provide APIs for structured data access, offering an alternative to scraping by delivering data in formats like **JSON** or **XML**.

## Use Cases of Web Scraping

- **Market Research**: Gathering pricing data, product listings, or competitor information.
- **Content Aggregation**: Collecting news articles, blog posts, or social media content for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting large datasets from multiple websites for machine learning or research purposes.
- **Monitoring**: Automatically tracking changes in web content, such as stock prices or flight rates.

## Ethical Considerations

- **robots.txt**: Always check the website’s **robots.txt** file to understand its scraping permissions.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with website **terms of service** and **data privacy policies** to avoid legal issues.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of scraping frequency to avoid overloading a server, which can lead to blocking or penalties.
