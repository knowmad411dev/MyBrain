## **Sense of Self

The "sense of self" refers to the feeling of being an individual with a distinct identity. The video you mentioned touches on the idea that many people perceive their [[Consciousness]] as being centered in their heads, often aligning with where we think our thoughts occur. Despite significant advances in neuroscience, researchers have not been able to definitively locate "self-awareness" within the brain. This suggests that consciousness and [[Identity]] are not tied to a single part of the brain but may emerge from complex interactions across multiple areas.
