## **7 AI Tools Helped Me Write Better Code

Coding can be hard sometimes, especially with bugs that are tough to fix.

I tried a lot of AI tools in 2024 but only 7 of those made sense for my developer workflow. The ones that actually helped me write better code.

Right now, I'm only using a couple of those but each tool on this list is worth it.

Let's understand how they helped me and how they can do the same for you.

[![[fa5eb0921ebc5371d8d5252e9bdff2ca_MD5.jpg]]](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxaiyy0hqn49483w6mvto.png)

I've always heard that testing should be the main focus and any code that is not tested is unreliable.

I believe a little knowledge of the codebase and automating the testing part is important because it might be overkill in other cases as there are different thresholds for people to ensure that the app works correctly.

That is where I came across [Qodo (previously known as CodiumAI)](https://www.qodo.ai/) and it was damn useful.

It's a developer AI tool that generates meaningful tests for code. It analyzes your code, docstring, comments and then suggests tests as you code.

It's super handy for properly testing complex stuff. It mainly provides:

\-‚Üí `Qodo Gen` : Define the coverage goal and qodo generates the tests accordingly. Detect bugs and document them.

\-‚Üí `Qodo Merge` : Make PRs less painful by providing reviewers a simple walkthrough and giving code suggestions ranked by severity.

Watch this quick 1-minute demo of how Qodo helps you get zero bugs!

You can download it from [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codium.codium) and [JetBrains extension](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21206-codiumai--meaningful-tests-in-python-powered-by-testgpt).

You would have heard about popular tools like PR Agent (for reviewing PRs) and Codiumate, they were made by the same team.

I'm mainly using it to validate the code by generating the tests since it's easy with context awareness. I haven't used it for every project but it's easier to use Qodo whenever I work with a new codebase (open source project).

Qodo is completely open source with all of its tools. You can check the repo below!

## [](https://dev.to/nozibul_islam_113b1d5334f/must-know-algorithms-3735#2-cursor)2\. [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

[![[315dbd109d6ca21408032fac29d4edf7_MD5.jpg]]](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fozl4568027b86ib1dg2r.png)

I have used VSCode for years and avoided AI editors due to a perception that AI-written code would take longer to debug. I assumed that it would just cancel the productivity but I gradually realized how wrong I was.

The problem is there are so many choices for AI-based editors like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/), [Void](https://voideditor.com/), [PearAI](https://trypear.ai/) and I'm sure there are many more out there.

I was skeptical at first, but I chose Cursor because many developers on Twitter were talking about it (maybe the hype got to me).

In my experience, Cursor actually understands your project, unlike other editors who just say it for the sake of saying it.

It gets your coding style, knows your project structure and even picks up on your team's best practices. It's just that good.

It's a fork of VS Code so you can just import the settings, themes, keybindings and extensions to maintain the same experience. The switch is very easy which is why developers started using it.

developers using cursor every second

I've used almost all of the features and was stunned. Let's briefly outline a few features with demo examples.

‚ö° Tab

Traditional auto-complete doesn't work that well, the Tab feature in Cursor is constantly working behind the scenes, analyzing your existing code and predicting your next move.

It's very accurate because it tracks your recent changes and the overall context of your project.

Intuitive cursor prediction (super accurate)

‚ö° ‚åò K

This command shortcut puts the full power of AI-assisted coding which can help you achieve code generation, refactoring a big chunk of code and so much more.

code generation on demand

![[2f654ffb6882162dfe97139968e9facf_MD5.gif]]

quick questions to get fast answers

‚ö° Terminal

The editor extends to the terminal and you just have to use ‚åò K in the terminal.

For example, instead of trying to remember the exact `find` command syntax, you could just type `Find all files added in the last 24 hours` and let Cursor do the heavy lifting.

‚ö° Chat

The cursor understands what file you're in and where your cursor is. It's like chatting with a dev who's looking at your screen. These conversations are context-aware which makes them far better.

‚ö° Composer

This is one of the most crazy features and can help generate an entire app from scratch. Yes, complete the functional codebase in minutes with all the necessary imports and boilerplate code.

If you're curious to know more features, models and terminologies like context or AI review, you can explore on the [official docs](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/migrate-from-vscode).

When I was starting, I just read the blog [The Ultimate Introduction to Cursor for Developers](https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-ai-for-developers) by the Builder.io team. This is a complete guide and is highly recommended!

I remember a time in my project when I was stuck on a problem. I went through 50+ Stack Overflow threads and even asked senior developers. That‚Äôs how frustrating it was!

Then ChatGPT came along, making it easier to find information. It could‚Äôve solved that issue much faster. Of course, when ChatGPT first launched, it wasn‚Äôt great at writing code. It took a few tries to get useful answers.

With new models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, it has become much better and now has a memory with context to provide more accurate answers.

At first, I used ChatGPT and DevGPT (which now limits you to 10 requests) to cross-check answers. But I eventually stopped using DevGPT.

Today, ChatGPT is way more advanced, with plugins and agents making them even more powerful.

Whenever I'm stuck with a coding problem, Perplexity is usually my first stop. It‚Äôs like a smarter, faster search engine that gives clear answers without making me sift through a bunch of links.

I prefer Perplexity over other search engines like Bing or Google because those are often filled with ads. On Perplexity, every answer feels direct and backed up with sources.

[![[95e697f3f1af0ad0eb2f227654b1dbb6_MD5.jpg]]](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5k23uwx13ymlegzypkxn.png)

starting dashboard looks like this

This briefly outlines a few features:

‚ö° There are six modes to accomplish different needs.

‚ö° You can discover new stuff to remain updated (don't really use it) and bookmark it for later.

[![[e89d8f1540e10e604c68d7602c5e7bac_MD5.jpg]]](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fivrrd8yxxf81ek1bheia.png)

‚ö° With any query, you can search for images and videos (on the right side). You can also check all the sources and see which ones are used for each point individually.

points summarized from which sources are clearly shown

I started using it because the user interface is very easy to pick on and the features just back that simplicity.

There is also an open source alternative of Perplexity which goes by the name of [Perplexica](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/). It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

They use SearxNG to stay current and has also 6 focus modes. You can definitely learn a bunch of stuff from the codebase.

A few months ago, I saw all the hype about Pieces on Twitter and decided to try it out.

It's an AI productivity tool designed to help developers organize their chaotic workflow. What sets it apart is its completely offline approach to AI, which gives a strong sense of privacy.

The best part is their full ecosystem, which includes a powerful desktop app called Pieces OS, a Chrome extension for transferring snippets, and a VSCode extension. When used together, they make a really powerful setup.

Pieces OS uses local LLMs, so everything runs 100% locally on your machine, though you can connect to the cloud for backups, sharing and using cloud-based LLMs for code generation.

[![[1b0be62dc110faf17faba6088d39854e_MD5.jpg]]](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgh090r1ajdltjwtdhky8.png)

‚úÖ I tried it for the live context which is basically hyper-aware assistance to guide you right back to where you left off. Like you can ask, `What was I working on an hour ago?` and it will give you all the details.

‚úÖ You can even browse docs (web browser) and let the AI learn from them. Then you can ask questions and it will answer using those docs.

You can see the complete [list of features](https://pieces.app/features/) that is available with Pieces.

I even covered a lot of interesting use cases with demo examples in the blog about how [Pieces is the only AI tool you need to be a 10x developerü§Ø](https://dev.to/anmolbaranwal/pieces-is-the-only-ai-tool-you-need-to-be-a-10x-developer-13le).

I understood the importance of documentation as a developer. But it's a lengthy process and things can get messy sometimes.

I was looking for a solution and came across Mintlify which uses AI to help you document the code in just a few seconds.

You can watch this video for the complete walkthrough!

As you can see, you just have to highlight the code or place the cursor on the line you want to document. Then click on the `Write Docs` button (or hit ‚åò + .)

It supports more than 10 major programming languages and a lot of docstring formats like JSDoc, reST, NumPy and more.

It was simple and automatically documents the code as you write so it was quite handy.

I mainly use it to document code for open source projects. I skip it when working solo on a codebase (unless it's complex) since I don‚Äôt see the need for documentation in that case. Overall, it‚Äôs much faster than starting from scratch.

Mintlify is open source.

I didn‚Äôt have a specific reason, just decided to try Continue as an AI coding assistant while working on a blog. It didn‚Äôt disappoint for sure.

The main reason might have been working with local LLMs to save some bucks. Plus, it can take context in the form of codebase, issues, docs and even files.

It's that simple. After you have configured it, you can use all the amazing concepts like:

‚ö° Tab feature to autocomplete code suggestions.

‚ö° Asking questions about your codebase.

‚ö° To understand terminal errors immediately.
