## **Cognitive Dissonance

**Cognitive dissonance** refers to the mental discomfort or psychological stress experienced when a person holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes simultaneously. This discomfort often leads individuals to change their beliefs, justify their behaviors, or seek new information to reduce the dissonance and restore mental consistency. Cognitive dissonance plays a key role in decision-making and rationalization.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Mental Conflict:** Arises from conflicting beliefs or behaviors.
- **Motivation for Change:** Drives individuals to reduce discomfort by altering beliefs or attitudes.
- **Rationalization:** People may justify behaviors to align with their beliefs.
