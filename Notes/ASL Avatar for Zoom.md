## **ASL Avatar for Zoom

To link an American Sign Language (ASL) avatar to a Zoom meeting, you'll need to integrate ASL avatar software with virtual webcam software. This setup allows you to display an animated ASL interpreter within your Zoom meeting, enhancing accessibility for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing. Below are the detailed steps along with related web links to guide you through the process.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Install Required Software**

    - **OBS Studio**: Download and install OBS Studio from the [official website](https://obsproject.com/).
    - **OBS WebSockets Plugin**: Install the obs-websocket plugin from the OBS Studio plugins store.
    - **ASL Avatar Software**: Choose and install one of the ASL avatar applications mentioned in the requirements.
    - **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.

2. **Configure OBS Studio**

    - **Start OBS Studio** and create a new scene.
    - Add the ASL avatar window as a "Window Capture" source.
    - Set up the scene layout to your preference.
    - Start the virtual camera in OBS Studio.

3. **Set Up OBS WebSockets**

    - In OBS Studio, go to **Tools** > **OBS WebSockets** > **Settings**.
    - Enable the WebSockets server and set a password if desired.
    - Note the server address and port for later use.

4. **Install Python Libraries**

    - Install the `obs-websocket-py` library:

        bash

        Copy

        pip install obs-websocket-py

    - For GUI (optional), install `tkinter` (usually included with Python):

        bash

        Copy

        pip install tk

5. **Create the Python Script**

    - Write a Python script to connect to OBS WebSockets and control the virtual camera.
    - Optionally, add functions to start and stop the ASL avatar software.

6. **Configure Zoom**

    - In Zoom, go to **Settings** > **Video**.
    - Set the virtual camera (e.g., "OBS Virtual Camera") as the primary camera.

7. **Run and Test the Setup**

    - Execute the Python script to start the virtual camera.
    - Start a Zoom meeting and verify that the ASL avatar is visible.

**Python Code**

Below is a Python script that connects to OBS WebSockets and controls the virtual camera:

python

Copy

import obsws_python as obs

import tkinter as tk

from tkinter import messagebox

# Configuration variables

OBS_HOST = 'localhost'

OBS_PORT = 4444

OBS_PASSWORD = 'your_password'  # Set to None if no password is set

class OBSController:

    def __init__(self, host, port, password):

        self.host = host

        self.port = port

        self.password = password

        self.obs = None

    def connect(self):
        try:
            self.obs = obs.ReqClient(host=self.host, port=self.port, password=self.password)
            messagebox.showinfo("Connection", "Connected to OBS WebSockets.")
        except Exception as e:
            messagebox.showerror("Connection Error", f"Failed to connect to OBS: {e}")

    def disconnect(self):
        if self.obs:
            self.obs.disconnect()
            self.obs = None
            messagebox.showinfo("Disconnected", "Disconnected from OBS WebSockets.")

    def start_virtual_camera(self):
        if self.obs:
            try:
                self.obs.set_output_enabled('VirtualCamera', True)
                messagebox.showinfo("Virtual Camera", "Virtual Camera started.")
            except Exception as e:
                messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Failed to start Virtual Camera: {e}")
        else:
            messagebox.showwarning("Not Connected", "Not connected to OBS.")

    def stop_virtual_camera(self):
        if self.obs:
            try:
                self.obs.set_output_enabled('VirtualCamera', False)
                messagebox.showinfo("Virtual Camera", "Virtual Camera stopped.")
            except Exception as e:
                messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Failed to stop Virtual Camera: {e}")
        else:
            messagebox.showwarning("Not Connected", "Not connected to OBS.")

def main():

    root = tk.Tk()

    root.title("OBS Virtual Camera Controller")

    controller = OBSController(OBS_HOST, OBS_PORT, OBS_PASSWORD)

    frame = tk.Frame(root)
    frame.pack(pady=20)

    connect_button = tk.Button(frame, text="Connect to OBS", command=controller.connect)
    connect_button.pack(pady=5)

    start_button = tk.Button(frame, text="Start Virtual Camera", command=controller.start_virtual_camera)
    start_button.pack(pady=5)

    stop_button = tk.Button(frame, text="Stop Virtual Camera", command=controller.stop_virtual_camera)
    stop_button.pack(pady=5)

    exit_button = tk.Button(frame, text="Exit", command=root.quit)
    exit_button.pack(pady=5)

    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

**Notes**

- **Security**: Be cautious with OBS WebSockets, as it can expose your OBS Studio instance to remote control. Always use a password in a production environment.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling and message boxes for feedback.
- **ASL Avatar Control**: If the ASL avatar software provides a command-line interface or API, you can extend the script to automate its start and stop functions.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.

**Instructions**

- **Run the Script**: Save the script as `obs_controller.py` and run it with Python:

    bash

    Copy

    python obs_controller.py

- **Connect to OBS**: Click "Connect to OBS" in the GUI to establish a connection.
- **Start/Stop Virtual Camera**: Use the corresponding buttons to control the virtual camera in OBS Studio.

**Conclusion**

This Python script provides a basic interface to control OBS Studio's virtual camera via WebSockets. You can expand this script to include additional functionalities, such as automating the ASL avatar software, managing scenes, or handling audio inputs. Always refer to the official documentation of the software you're using for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
