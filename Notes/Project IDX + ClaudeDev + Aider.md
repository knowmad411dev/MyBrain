## **Setting Up Project IDX**

### **1. Accessing Project IDX**

1. Visit the [Project IDX website](https://idx.dev).
2. Choose a template to start your project (e.g., Next.js, Angular, Python, or blank).
3. Customize the setup (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).
4. Click **Create** to initialize the workspace.

### **2. Enabling Gemini AI Features**

1. Click on the **Gemini** option in the interface.
2. Enable the feature when prompted.
3. Features include:
   - Basic chats.
   - Context-aware code assistance.
   - Code generation and insertion.
   - Autocomplete and inline suggestions.

### **3. Installing Extensions**

You can enhance your experience by installing extensions. For example:

1. Go to the Extensions tab.
2. Search for desired extensions like **Claud Dev** or **AER**.

## **Using Claud Dev**

Claud Dev is an AI coding assistant that helps with generating and iterating on code.

### **Installing Claud Dev**

1. Search for “Claud Dev” in the Extensions tab and install it.
2. Set up a provider:
   - Options include Anthropics, Gemini, Gro, Sambanova, or Vertex AI.
   - Enter the API key for your chosen provider.
3. Refresh the window to activate the setup.

### **Creating a Simple App**

1. Open Claud Dev from the sidebar.
2. Use prompts to generate a sample app (e.g., a To-Do app).
3. Accept the generated code and preview it in the live interface.
4. Iterate and refine the app using further prompts.

## **Using AER**

AER is a powerful AI coding tool for edits and refinements.

### **Installing AER**

1. Open the terminal in Project IDX.
2. Ensure Python is listed in the “dev.nix” file under packages. If not, add it and refresh the environment.
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install AER:
   ```bash
   pip install aer
   ```

### **Setting Up AER**

1. Export the environment variable for the desired provider (e.g., Anthropics):
   ```bash
   export PROVIDER=anthropic
   ```
2. Start AER with the chosen model and begin coding.

### **Example: Creating a Minesweeper Game**

1. Prompt AER to generate a Minesweeper game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Review the generated code and test it in the live preview.

## **Hosting and Collaboration**

### **Firebase Hosting**

1. Add Firebase hosting to your project:
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```
2. Deploy your application with a single command:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

### **Sharing Previews**

1. Use the live preview link to collaborate with others.
2. Share the link for real-time feedback.
