## **Automate GitHub AI

Here's a detailed overview of how you can automate your GitHub workflow using AI to write, fix, and merge code—all from your browser.

### Overview of Automating GitHub with AI

The process of automating GitHub includes tasks such as:

1. Writing code automatically.
2. Identifying and fixing errors.
3. Creating pull requests automatically.
4. Merging the code into the main branch.

All these can be done using a conversational AI tool integrated with GitHub. Specifically, this walkthrough uses **Chat LLM for Teams**, which can communicate with GitHub, modify code, and manage the whole pull request process. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to achieve this step-by-step.

### Steps to Automate GitHub Workflow Using AI

#### Step 1: Set Up a Repository in GitHub

- **Create a New Repository**: Start by creating a repository in GitHub, which is where your code will be saved.
- **Naming the Repository**: Choose a meaningful name for your repository and click to create it.

#### Step 2: Add Code to Your Repository

- After creating your repository, add code by following these steps:
  - Navigate to the repository.
  - Use GitHub's options to upload or write code directly in the repo.

#### Step 3: Connect Chat LLM for Teams to GitHub

1. **Log in to Chat LLM for Teams**:
   - Once logged in, navigate to the tool section labeled **GitHub Connect**.
2. **Allow Permissions**:
   - You will be redirected to GitHub to allow permissions. Grant permission to allow the AI tool to make modifications in your repository.
3. **Install the Abacus AI App**:
   - Follow the prompt to install the Abacus AI app in GitHub. You’ll be redirected to a page where you can install this app.
4. **Choose the Repository**:
   - After installing the app, select the repository that you want to automate.
   - Select the files you want the AI to access, then click **Add Files**. This adds the relevant files to the AI context.

#### Step 4: Automate Code Modifications Using AI

1. **Issue a Command to Modify Code**:
   - In the AI interface, you can issue a command, for example: "Create a sidebar and move the description to the sidebar."
2. **AI Processes the Request**:
   - The AI analyzes the code and responds by suggesting the changes it can make.
   - For example, it might say: "I can create a sidebar with index.html and style.css changes. Would you like me to proceed?"
3. **Proceed with Changes**:
   - Confirm the changes by clicking **Please proceed**.
   - The AI then generates the required HTML and CSS changes to create the sidebar.

#### Step 5: Create a Pull Request

1. **Generate a Pull Request**:
   - After modifying the code, you can click **Create Pull Request**.
   - The AI will prompt you to create a feature branch (e.g., `feature-sidebar`) and then create a pull request.
2. **View the Pull Request**:
   - You’ll receive a link to the pull request. Clicking this link will display the details.
   - The pull request will include:
     - **Title and Description**: A clear description of what changes were made.
     - **File Changes**: A list of all modified files.

#### Step 6: Review and Merge the Pull Request

1. **Review Code Changes**:
   - Click on **File Changes** to see exactly what the AI modified. You will see changes to files like `index.html` or `style.css`, reflecting the addition of the sidebar.
2. **Merge to Main Branch**:
   - To apply the changes to the production environment, click **Merge Pull Request**. This merges the updated code with your **main branch**, making it live.

#### Step 7: Testing Locally

- After merging the changes, you can test locally by pulling the latest changes from the GitHub main branch to your local environment.

### Practical Example: Adding a Sidebar to a To-Do List App

- In the video, the creator used Chat LLM for Teams to modify a simple to-do list app.
  - **Command Given**: "Create a sidebar and move the description to the sidebar."
  - **AI Response**: The AI generated the required HTML and CSS changes.
  - **Pull Request Created**: The AI created a pull request detailing the changes made to `index.html` and `style.css`.
  - **Merge**: The pull request was merged into the main branch, making the changes live.

### Benefits of Using Git for Automation

- **Revisions**: Git allows you to create multiple revisions of your code, which means you can revert to an older version if needed.
- **Testing**: You can test changes in a branch before merging them to the production code (main branch).
- **AI-Assisted Modifications**: Using AI ensures faster iteration and allows even beginners to modify and manage complex codebases without manually writing each line of code.

### Tools Used

- **Chat LLM for Teams**: A powerful AI tool that allows you to write code, identify errors, create pull requests, and more. It integrates directly with GitHub for an all-in-one workflow solution.
- **Abacus AI**: An app installed on GitHub that facilitates the integration between Chat LLM for Teams and GitHub repositories.

### Additional Features of Chat LLM for Teams

Chat LLM for Teams offers more than just GitHub automation:

- **Multiple Language Model Access**: Choose from different LLMs to suit your needs.
- **User Management Profiles**: Manage multiple users within the same workspace.
- **Code Text Editor**: Write, view, and edit code directly in your browser.
- **Preview Functionality**: View how code will look and perform.
- **Web Search and AI Creation Tools**: Generate images, videos, PDFs, and more.
- **Pricing**: $10 per user per month.

### Summary

Automating GitHub workflows using Chat LLM for Teams allows you to:

1. Write and modify code using natural language.
2. Automatically identify errors and make fixes.
3. Generate pull requests and merge changes—all from your browser.

This tool is especially helpful for beginners, as it allows them to make modifications without deep technical expertise in Git and coding. Advanced users can also benefit from the speed and efficiency of using AI for repetitive or complex tasks.

Using this approach, even tasks like adding a new sidebar to a to-do list application can be accomplished seamlessly by just issuing commands and allowing the AI to handle the rest.

### How to Get Started

- **Sign Up**: Sign up for Chat LLM for Teams (link provided in the original video).
- **Connect to GitHub**: Connect your GitHub account, grant necessary permissions, and install Abacus AI.
- **Start Automating**: Use the AI to write, modify, and manage your GitHub code. Explore features like creating branches, generating pull requests, and testing code modifications with ease.
