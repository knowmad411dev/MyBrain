### Philosophy: A Detailed Overview

**Definition**
Philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It seeks to understand the nature of reality, the limits of human understanding, and the ethical implications of human behavior. Philosophy is both an academic discipline and a method of critical inquiry.

**Branches of Philosophy**
