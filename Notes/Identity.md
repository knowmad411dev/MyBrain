### **Definition**:

**Identity** refers to the characteristics, beliefs, values, and roles that define an individual or group. It encompasses both personal identity (how one views oneself) and social identity (how one fits into broader social groups).

### **Key Components**:

1. **Personal Identity**: The unique attributes, experiences, and characteristics that define an individual’s sense of self.
2. **Social Identity**: The aspects of an individual’s identity that arise from belonging to groups (e.g., nationality, religion, profession).
3. **Cultural Identity**: Shared characteristics and values shaped by one's cultural background or community.
4. **Role Identity**: How individuals define themselves based on the roles they perform in society (e.g., parent, employee, friend).

### **Development of Identity**:

- **Self-Concept**: Formed through personal reflection, experiences, and feedback from others.
- **Socialization**: Identity is influenced by interactions with family, peers, and society, shaping one’s beliefs, values, and behaviors.
- **Narrative Identity**: The ongoing story individuals construct about their life, which integrates past, present, and future experiences into a coherent whole.

### **Theories of Identity**:

- **Erikson’s Stages of Psychosocial Development**: Identity is developed through a series of crises during life stages, particularly during adolescence.
- **Social Identity Theory**: Individuals derive a sense of identity based on their group memberships and comparison to others.
