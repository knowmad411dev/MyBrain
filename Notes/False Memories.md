## **False Memories

### **Definition**:

False memories are recollections of events that either did not occur or are significantly altered from the original event. [[Memory]] is reconstructive, meaning it is rebuilt each time it is recalled, making it vulnerable to distortion over time.

### **Key Insights**:

- **Reconstructive Nature of Memory**: Unlike a perfect recording, memory is rebuilt during recall, which can lead to inaccuracies.
- **Influences on False Memories**: Suggestion, social interactions, and emotional states can all contribute to the formation of false memories.
- **Implications for [[Identity]]**: Since our sense of self is partly built on our recollection of past experiences, false memories can impact our personal identity and how we view ourselves.

### **Applications**:

- **Legal System**: False memories have serious consequences in legal cases, particularly concerning wrongful convictions based on repressed or fabricated memories.
- **Personal Reflection**: Understanding how false memories form can help individuals critically evaluate their own recollections and beliefs about their past.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Self]]**: Memory plays a crucial role in constructing oneâ€™s identity.
- **[[Cognitive Bias]]**: Biases can influence how memories are reconstructed and lead to distortions.
- **[[Memory]]**: False memories are an important subfield of memory research, with broad implications for understanding human cognition.
