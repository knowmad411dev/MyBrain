## **Loss Aversion

### **Definition**:

**Loss Aversion** is a [[Cognitive Bias]] in behavioral economics where individuals prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. People often feel the pain of a loss more strongly than the pleasure of a similar-sized gain.

### **Key Interaction**:

- **[[Framing Bias]]**: The way a scenario is presented can influence how individuals perceive potential losses or gains. Emphasizing losses tends to result in more cautious decision-making, whereas focusing on gains can encourage risk-taking.

### **Example**:

- People may reject a 50% chance of losing $100, even if it comes with a 50% chance of gaining $100, due to the emotional impact of the potential loss.

### **Implications**:

- **[[Decision-Making]]**: Loss aversion can lead to overly conservative choices, even when potential gains outweigh the risks.
- **Behavioral Economics**: Marketers and policymakers often use loss aversion in designing incentives and interventions, framing situations to either encourage or discourage certain behaviors.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Framing Bias]]**: Loss aversion is often influenced by how information is framed, affecting decisions based on perceived losses or gains.
- **[[Bias]]**: One of many cognitive biases impacting decision-making and risk perception.
