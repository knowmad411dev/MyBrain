# Map of Content (MOC)

A **Map of Content (MOC)** is a structured overview or hub that organizes and links to other notes within a **personal knowledge management (PKM)** system. MOCs serve as **index notes** or **navigation hubs**, providing a clear path to related notes and topics, helping you manage large volumes of information more effectively.

---

## Purpose of a Map of Content

- **Centralized Organization**: MOCs group related notes and act as **table of contents** for specific subjects or projects.
- **Navigation Hub**: They allow easy navigation between interconnected ideas, making it simpler to explore a topic in depth.
- **Visualize Connections**: MOCs reveal the structure and relationships between notes, showing the **big picture** and how individual notes fit within a broader context.

---

## Key Features

- **Topic-Based Structure**: MOCs are usually organized by a specific theme or area of interest (e.g., **Research Notes**, **Learning Strategies**, **Project Management**).
- **Linked Notes**: MOCs contain links to other notes, helping you move seamlessly between related ideas.
- **Dynamic Updates**: As your knowledge system grows, MOCs evolve, with new notes and connections added to reflect the expanding network.

## Example of an MOC

A **Map of Content** for **[[Note-Taking]] strategies** might include links to individual notes on the **Cornell Method**, **[[Feynman Technique]]**, **[[Progressive Summarization]]**, and **[[Zettelkasten]]**. Each of these notes would be accessible from the MOC, allowing quick navigation between them.

## Benefits of Using MOCs

1. **Enhanced Organization**: MOCs bring structure to a knowledge system, grouping notes in a logical and accessible way.
2. **Quick Navigation**: They provide an easy way to access and explore a collection of notes related to a specific subject.
3. **Big-Picture View**: MOCs help you see how individual notes and ideas connect within a larger framework.

## How to Create a Map of Content

1. **Choose a Topic**: Select a central theme or project to create an MOC around.
2. **Link Related Notes**: Add links to all relevant notes, making it easy to navigate between them.
3. **Update Regularly**: Continuously update the MOC as new notes and insights emerge, keeping the map reflective of your growing knowledge.
