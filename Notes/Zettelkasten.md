# Zettelkasten

The **Zettelkasten** (German for "slip box") is a **[[Personal Knowledge Management]] system** developed by sociologist **Niklas Luhmann**. It facilitates **idea generation** and **knowledge organization** by using **atomic notes** that are linked together to form a network of interconnected ideas.

## Purpose of Zettelkasten

- **Organize [[Knowledge]]**: Promotes **creativity** and **[[Deep Learning]]** by connecting ideas through the **linking** of notes.
- **Structure**: Each note captures a single idea (an **Atomic Note**) and is linked to other relevant notes, creating a **knowledge web**.

## Key Concepts of Zettelkasten

- **Atomic Notes**: Each note is **self-contained** and captures one idea, promoting **clarity** and enabling links between different concepts.
- **Linking and Non-Linear Thinking**: Notes are **linked** to each other, allowing for **non-linear exploration** of knowledge and the discovery of **associative connections**.

## Why Use Zettelkasten?

- **Enhanced Creativity**: Linking different ideas fosters **emergent insights** and the discovery of unexpected connections.
- **Long-Term Retention**: Writing and linking notes in your own words helps solidify ideas in **long-term memory**.
- **Scalability**: The system grows with your knowledge, making it easy to revisit and integrate older notes into new insights.
