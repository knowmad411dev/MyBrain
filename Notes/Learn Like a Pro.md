## **Learn Like a Pro

"Learn Like a Pro: Science-Based Techniques to Accelerate Your Learning" by Barbara Oakley and Olav Schewe is a comprehensive guide that offers practical, research-backed strategies to improve learning efficiency and effectiveness. Here's a detailed summary of the key concepts and techniques presented in the book:

## Understanding the Learning Process

The authors begin by explaining how learning works at a neurological level:

1. **Long-term memory**: Learning occurs when information enters and stays in long-term memory[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).
2. **Neural connections**: When we learn, neurons connect and form pathways. Complex learning creates longer pathways and webs of connections[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).
3. **Strengthening connections**: Repeated practice strengthens neural bonds, cementing learning in long-term memory[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).

## Two Learning Systems

Oakley and Schewe describe two primary systems for learning:

1. **Declarative learning system**: Stores information in conscious memory for purposeful recall. It works through logical, sequential steps[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).
2. **Procedural learning system**: Deposits information into subconscious memory, allowing for automatic recall of familiar skills. It works by sensing patterns through repeated exposure or practice[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).

The authors emphasize that effective learning utilizes both systems.

## Key Techniques for Effective Learning

## Active Studying

The book advocates for active studying techniques over passive ones:

- Using flashcards
- Explaining concepts and their relationships
- Brainstorming potential test questions
- Working through practice problems[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/)

## Spaced Repetition and Interleaving

Studying in frequent, small chunks and mixing different types of content during study sessions is recommended[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/).

## Memory Techniques

The authors suggest using:

- Acronyms
- Metaphors
- Other mnemonic devices[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/)

## The Pomodoro Technique

To combat procrastination, the book recommends:

1. Removing all distractions
2. Setting a timer for 25 minutes of focused work
3. Taking a 5-minute break (avoiding smartphone use)[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/)

## Goal Setting

The authors advise setting SMART goals:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Ambitious
- Realistic
- Time-limited[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/)

## Enhancing Motivation and Focus

The book offers several strategies to boost motivation and maintain focus:

1. Working with study groups
2. Finding personal value in the work
3. Practicing metacognitive awareness
4. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle (exercise, sleep, balanced diet)[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/)

## Test-Taking Strategies

Oakley and Schewe provide specific advice for test-taking:

1. Carefully reading instructions and questions
2. Managing time effectively during the test
3. Previewing difficult questions at the start
4. Reviewing answers at the end[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/)

## Overcoming Learning Challenges

The authors address common learning obstacles:

1. **Procrastination**: Using techniques like the Pomodoro method to overcome it[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/).
2. **Distractions**: Removing temptations and creating a conducive study environment[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/).
3. **Lack of motivation**: Setting clear goals and finding personal value in the material[2](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything-by-barbara-oakley-and-olav-schewe/).
4. **Difficulty with certain subjects**: Emphasizing that struggles often stem from approach rather than innate ability[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).

## Neuroscience-Based Insights

The book incorporates cutting-edge neuroscience research to debunk common learning myths:

1. Note-taking isn't always beneficial
2. Speed-reading techniques are ineffective
3. Adult language learning requires different strategies than childhood language acquisition[4](https://www.classcentral.com/course/how-to-learn-barbara-oakley-olav-schewe-learn-lik-40292)

## Conclusion

"Learn Like a Pro" emphasizes that anyone can become a better learner by understanding how the brain functions and adopting appropriate learning methods. The authors draw from their personal experiences of overcoming learning difficulties to provide practical, science-based tools for mastering any subject or skill[3](https://www.shortform.com/blog/learn-like-a-pro-science-based-tools-to-become-better-at-anything/).By combining declarative and procedural learning systems, utilizing active study techniques, managing motivation, and applying neuroscience-based strategies, learners can significantly enhance their ability to acquire and retain knowledge effectively.
