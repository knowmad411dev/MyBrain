### Libraries Covered

1. **PyPDF2**
2. **PDFPlumber**
3. **PyMuPDF (also known as Fitz)**

### 1. PyPDF2

**PyPDF2** is a versatile library for simple extraction of text and images from PDF files.

**Features:**

- Extract text from PDF pages.
- Extract images from PDF files.

**Installation:** To install PyPDF2, use the following command:

```
pip install PyPDF2
```

**Usage Example: Extracting Text and Images**

1. **Import the Library:**

```
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader
```

2. **Create a Reader Object:**

```python
reader = PdfReader("file.pdf")  # Replace 'file.pdf' with your PDF file name
```

3. **Get Number of Pages:**

```python
num_pages = len(reader.pages)
print(f"Number of pages: {num_pages}")
```

4. **Extract Text from a Specific Page:**

```python
page = reader.pages[0]  # Indexing starts at 0
text = page.extract_text()
print(text)
```

5. **Extract Text from All Pages:**

```python
for i in range(num_pages):
    page = reader.pages[i]
    text = page.extract_text()
    print(f"Page {i+1} Text:\n{text}\n")
```

6. **Extract Images from a Page:**

```python
for i, img in enumerate(page.images):
    with open(img.name, "wb") as f:
        f.write(img.data)
    print(f"Saved image {i+1}: {img.name}")
```

### 2. PDFPlumber

**PDFPlumber** excels in extracting tables and structured data from PDFs, in addition to text extraction.

**Features:**

- Extract text and images.
- **Extract tables** with high accuracy.

**Installation:**

```
pip install pdfplumber
```

**Usage Example: Extracting Tables**

1. **Import the Library:**

```python
import pdfplumber
```

2. **Open the PDF File:**

```python
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        print(f"Page {i+1} Tables: {tables}\n")
```

**Explanation:**

- The `extract_tables()` method returns a list of tables found on each page.
- Each table is represented as a list of rows, where each row is a list of cell values.

### 3. PyMuPDF (Fitz)

**PyMuPDF**, also known as **Fitz**, is a powerful library for advanced PDF manipulation, including text extraction, image extraction, metadata access, converting PDFs to images, and handling links.

**Features:**

- Extract text and images.
- Access and modify metadata.
- Convert PDF pages to images.
- Extract links (both internal and external).

**Installation:**

```
pip install PyMuPDF
```

**Usage Example: Advanced PDF Processing**

1. **Import the Library:**

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
```

2. **Open the PDF Document:**

```python
doc = fitz.open("file.pdf")  # Replace 'file.pdf' with your PDF file name
```

3. **Get Number of Pages:**

```python
num_pages = doc.page_count
print(f"Number of pages: {num_pages}")
```

4. **Access Metadata:**

```python
metadata = doc.metadata
print("Metadata:", metadata)
```

5. **Extract Text from a Specific Page:**

```python
page = doc.load_page(0)  # Indexing starts at 0
text = page.get_text()
print(text)
```

6. **Convert a Page to an Image:**

```python
pix = page.get_pixmap()
pix.save(f"page_{page.number}.png")
print(f"Saved page {page.number} as image.")
```

7. **Extract Links from a Page:**

```python
links = page.get_links()
for link in links:
    print(link)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Metadata:** Access details like title, author, subject, etc.
- **get_pixmap():** Renders the page as an image (e.g., PNG).
- **get_links():** Retrieves all links present on the page, distinguishing between internal and external links.
