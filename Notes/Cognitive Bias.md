### **Cognitive Biases**

- **Description**: Humans often rely on mental shortcuts to make decisions, but these can lead to **cognitive biases**â€”systematic errors in thinking.
- **Example**: The **availability bias** occurs when we assess the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind, leading to distorted risk assessments.

### **Mitigating Biases**:

1. **Slow Down**: Engage in more deliberate thinking rather than snap judgments.
2. **Question Assumptions**: Reflect on initial conclusions to check for bias.
3. **Seek Diverse Perspectives**: Incorporate different viewpoints to challenge personal biases.
