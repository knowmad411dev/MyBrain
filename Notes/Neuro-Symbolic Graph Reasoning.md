# **Neuro-Symbolic Graph Reasoning**

**Integrating Neural Networks and Symbolic AI Using Knowledge Graphs**

---

The text discusses the integration of [[Neural Networks]], specifically large language models ([[LLM]]s), with symbolic AI systems like knowledge graphs to enhance [[Artificial intelligence]] capabilities. This neurosymbolic approach leverages the strengths of both paradigms—pattern recognition from neural networks and logical reasoning from symbolic AI—to address complex, domain-specific problems that neither system could manage effectively on its own.

### Key Studies and Research

1. **Empowering Domain-Specific LLMs with Graph-Oriented Databases**

    - **Authors/Institution**: Researchers from Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    - **Overview**: This study explores how integrating neural models with graph databases can improve explainability, reduce latency, and boost overall system performance. By combining LLMs with graph-oriented databases, the research aims to enhance domain-specific language models.

2. **Neurosymbolic Entity Alignment**

    - **Authors/Institution**: Researchers from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Computing.
    - **Overview**: The paper discusses aligning entities across different knowledge graphs using a neurosymbolic approach. For example, combining a biomedical knowledge graph with a pharmaceutical one to mine cross-disciplinary relationships and discover new patterns. The neurosymbolic method outperforms purely symbolic or neural methodologies in both effectiveness and robustness.

3. **Knowledge Graph-Based Agents for Complex Knowledge-Intensive Questions in Allergy Medicine**

    - **Authors/Institution**: Collaborators from Harvard University and Pfizer.
    - **Overview**: This research focuses on using knowledge graph-based agents to handle complex, knowledge-intensive queries in allergy medicine. By integrating neural systems with symbolic AI, the agents can provide accurate and robust reasoning for medical queries, verifying information against structured biomedical data stored in knowledge graphs.

### Common Themes Across the Studies

- **Integration of Neural and Symbolic Systems**: All three studies emphasize the importance of combining neural models (like LLMs) with symbolic AI (like knowledge graphs) to enhance reasoning capabilities.
- **Domain-Specific Applications**: The integration is particularly effective in specialized fields such as biomedicine, where complex relationships and vast amounts of data exist.
- **Improved Performance and Explainability**: Combining the two approaches leads to better system performance, increased robustness, and improved explainability, making AI outputs more trustworthy and transparent.

### Practical Example: Enhancing a Knowledge Graph with Neurosymbolic Insights

#### Scenario

- **Domain**: Biomedical Research
- **Objective**: Analyze a vast collection of biomedical research papers to extract meaningful insights about specific relationships, such as drug interactions, disease correlations, and protein functions.

#### Steps

1. **Data Processing with Neural Models**

    - **Entity and Relationship Extraction**: Use LLMs to process unstructured text and identify entities like diseases, proteins, and drugs, as well as relationships between them.
    - **Tools**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and relation extraction models.

2. **Structuring Knowledge with Symbolic Systems**

    - **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Organize the extracted entities and relationships into a knowledge graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships.
    - **Logical Consistency**: Apply symbolic reasoning to ensure logical consistency within the knowledge graph.
    - **Tools**: Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) and rule-based reasoning engines.

3. **Enhancing the Knowledge Graph**

    - **Infer New Insights**: Use neurosymbolic methods to infer new relationships not explicitly mentioned in the text, such as potential drug-disease interactions.
    - **Rule Learning**: The system can deduce new logical rules from the data, enhancing the knowledge graph's depth and utility.
    - **Tools**: Combination of neural reasoning (e.g., graph neural networks) and symbolic AI.

#### Outcome

- **Enhanced Knowledge Base**: The knowledge graph becomes richer and more informative.
- **Actionable Insights**: New, previously unknown relationships are discovered, aiding in research and decision-making.
- **Transparency and Trust**: The system provides explanations for its inferences, increasing trustworthiness.

### Detailed Example: Logical Deduction Using a Simple Text

#### Input Text

`John is a teacher at a high school. He teaches mathematics. Mary is a student in his class.`

#### Goal

- **Extract and Structure Information**: Convert the text into structured data using JSON or a graph-based format.
- **Apply Neural and Symbolic Systems**: Use both approaches to derive deeper insights and logical inferences.
- **Integrate Insights**: Combine outputs from both systems to enhance understanding.

#### Steps

1. **Information Extraction**

    - **Entities**: John (Teacher), Mary (Student), High School (Organization), Mathematics (Subject).
    - **Relationships**: John teaches Mathematics, John works at High School, Mary is a student in John's class.

2. **Structured Representation**

    ```
    {
      "entities": [
        {"id": 1, "type": "Person", "name": "John", "role": "Teacher"},
        {"id": 2, "type": "Person", "name": "Mary", "role": "Student"},
        {"id": 3, "type": "Organization", "name": "High School"},
        {"id": 4, "type": "Subject", "name": "Mathematics"}
      ],
      "relationships": [
        {"from": 1, "to": 3, "relation": "works_at"},
        {"from": 1, "to": 4, "relation": "teaches"},
        {"from": 2, "to": 1, "relation": "student_of"}
      ]
    }
    ```

3. **Neural System Application**

    - **Pattern Recognition**: Identify that teachers often hold degrees in the subjects they teach.
    - **Inference**: John likely holds a degree in Mathematics.
    - **Prediction**: Mary might be interested in other STEM subjects like Physics.

4. **Symbolic System Application**

    - **Rule Definition**: If a teacher teaches a subject, they must be qualified in that subject.
    - **Logical Deduction**: John is qualified in Mathematics.
    - **Additional Rules**: Students often take multiple related subjects.

5. **Integration of Insights**

    - **Enhanced Graph**: Add inferred nodes and relationships, such as John's qualification and Mary's potential interests.
