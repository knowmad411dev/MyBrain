## **Machine Vision**

Machine Vision, also known as computer vision, is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves the use of cameras, sensors, and algorithms to capture, process, and analyze images or video. Machine vision applications include:

- **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects, people, or features within an image.
- **Object Detection**: Locating and classifying multiple objects in a scene.
- **Quality Control**: Inspecting products on manufacturing lines for defects.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Enabling vehicles to perceive and navigate their environment.

Machine vision is crucial in areas such as robotics, surveillance, healthcare, and industrial automation, where visual data processing is essential for [[Decision-Making]] and [[Automation]].
