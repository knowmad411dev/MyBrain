### **Bias**

- **Description**: Bias is a systematic inclination to think or act in a particular way based on subjective beliefs or influences, rather than objective evidence. It affects perception, judgment, and [[Decision-Making]], often leading to errors or irrational thinking.
- **Types of Bias**:

    1. **[[Cognitive Bias]]**: Mental shortcuts that can distort thinking, such as [[Confirmation Bias]] and [[Anchoring Bias]].
    2. **Social Biases**: Prejudices based on social factors, like race or gender, including [[Implicit Bias]] and stereotyping.
    3. **[[Emotional Biases]]**: When emotions drive decisions, such as [[Loss Aversion]], where fear of loss outweighs potential gains.
    4. **[[Statistical Biases]]**: Errors in data or experiments, like Sampling Bias and Selection Bias, which lead to skewed results.
- **Impact**: Biases influence behavior, interactions, decisions, and research, often leading to flawed reasoning or unfair outcomes. Recognizing biases is essential for improving [[Critical Thinking]] and fairness in decision-making.
