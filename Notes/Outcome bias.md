## **Outcome bias

### **Definition**:

**Outcome Bias** is the tendency to judge a decision based solely on its final result, rather than evaluating the quality of the decision-making process at the time it was made. This bias ignores whether the decision was logical and well-reasoned given the available information.

### **Key Characteristics**:

- **Focus on Results**: Judging decisions based on their outcomes rather than on the soundness of the decision-making process.
- **Hindsight Bias**: People often believe the outcome was predictable after the fact, distorting how the decision is perceived.
- **Unfair Judgment**: Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes due to factors outside of control, while poor decisions may sometimes result in success by chance.

### **Example**:

- A company launches a product after thorough research, but the product fails. If the decision to launch is judged as poor solely due to the failure, ignoring the well-considered process behind it, this reflects outcome bias.

### **Implications**:

- **[[Decision-Making]]**: Evaluating decisions based only on outcomes can undermine the importance of a sound decision-making process.
- **[[Learning]] from Mistakes**: Outcome bias may prevent learning from well-made decisions that didn’t turn out as expected, or from poor decisions that happened to lead to success.

### **Ways to Mitigate**:

- **Process-Based Evaluation**: Focus on the reasoning and process behind a decision, not just the result.
- **Awareness**: Recognizing outcome bias helps improve decision-making and ensures a more objective evaluation of success or failure.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Hindsight Bias]]**: The distortion of seeing events as predictable after they’ve occurred.
- **[[Bias]]**: Outcome bias is one of many cognitive biases that affect judgment and evaluation.
