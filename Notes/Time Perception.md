## **Time Perception

Time is explored as a subjective and non-linear concept, warped by gravity and velocity. Einstein's theories show that time can differ based on these factors, and time may not flow uniformly.

Time [[Perception]] deals with how we experience and estimate the passage of time. The brain doesn’t have a dedicated "clock" like a mechanical one, but rather uses many cues—such as changes in the environment or physiological states—to estimate time. Factors like attention, emotions, and even our level of consciousness can distort time perception. For example, time may seem to slow down in moments of danger or speed up when we're deeply focused.
