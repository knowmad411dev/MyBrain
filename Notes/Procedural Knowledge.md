## **Procedural Knowledge

**Definition**:
Procedural [[Knowledge]], also known as "know-how," refers to the ability to perform tasks and processes. It involves understanding the steps and methods needed to carry out specific actions, often gained through practice and experience. Unlike declarative knowledge, which focuses on facts and information, procedural knowledge is more about skills and actions.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Skill-Based**: Involves performing tasks, such as riding a bike, programming, or cooking.
- **Sequential**: Often follows a set of steps or procedures.
- **Tacit Component**: Can be difficult to articulate; often learned through practice rather than verbal explanation.
- **Practical Application**: Used directly in problem-solving and task execution.

**Examples**:

- Driving a car.
- Solving a mathematical equation.
- Performing a surgical procedure.
- Writing a computer program.

**Related Concepts**:

- **[[Declarative Knowledge]]**: Knowing facts and information (e.g., knowing what a car is).
- **[[Tacit Knowledge]]**: Implicit understanding that is hard to verbalize, often a part of procedural knowledge.
- **Skill Acquisition**: The process of developing procedural knowledge through practice.

**Use Cases**:

- **Education & Training**: Procedural knowledge is taught through hands-on practice, simulations, and repeated exercises.
- **[[Automation]]**: Procedural knowledge can be embedded into algorithms and software to automate tasks.
