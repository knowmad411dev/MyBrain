## **Machine Learning**

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms and statistical models that identify patterns in data to make predictions or decisions. ML can be categorized into three main types:

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data to predict outcomes for new data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding hidden patterns or groupings in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning optimal actions through trial and error, guided by rewards or penalties.

Machine Learning powers applications such as recommendation systems, natural language processing, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles, making it a critical component of modern AI development.
