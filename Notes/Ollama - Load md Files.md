# Ollama - Load Markdown Files

To load your Obsidian markdown notes into Ollama, follow these steps:

## 1. Organize Your Notes Folder

- Make sure all your notes are in one accessible folder or subfolders within a main directory.
- If you have your Obsidian vault organized in a particular structure, you can use the main vault folder as your target directory.

## 2. Export Your Notes (If Necessary)

- If your notes are already in markdown (.md) format, there's no need to export them.
- If you have mixed file formats, convert them all to markdown, which is the preferred format for Ollama to analyze text.

## 3. Check Ollama's Documentation for Importing Notes

- Ollama often uses scripts or APIs to ingest text data. Find the specific method to import markdown files based on the model you’re using.
- This might involve setting up a command-line tool or configuring a local endpoint to ingest data.

## 4. Use an Ingestion Script

- You may need to create a script (likely in Python or another language supported by Ollama) to load the files from your Obsidian directory into Ollama.
- The script will typically involve:
    - **Reading the Markdown Files**: The script would go through each file in your folder, read its content, and prepare it for ingestion.
    - **Ingesting the Content into Ollama**: Use Ollama's API or commands to send the content from the files to Ollama for indexing and analysis.

## 5. Ensure Processing and Analysis

- Once your notes are loaded into Ollama, allow it to process and analyze the content. This may involve some wait time depending on the size of your notes and the capabilities of your system.

## 6. Review the Data in Ollama

- After ingestion, use Ollama’s features to search for patterns, keywords, and concepts in your notes.
- Depending on Ollama’s tools, you can query specific themes or relationships between the content of different markdown files.

If you need help with a specific script or command for ingesting markdown notes into Ollama, let me know!

### Example Python Script to Load Markdown Files into Ollama

Here's an example of a simple Python program that loads markdown files into Ollama. This assumes that Ollama provides an API endpoint to ingest data (you may need to replace the placeholders with your actual API details).

#### Prerequisites

- **Install Required Packages**: You need the `requests` package to make API calls:

    ```
    pip install requests
    ```

- **Ensure Ollama API is Running**: Make sure your Ollama instance is running locally or accessible through an endpoint.

#### Python Script

```Python
import os
import requests

# Configure these variables
OLLAMA_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api/ingest'  # Replace with your Ollama API endpoint
NOTES_DIRECTORY = '/path/to/your/obsidian/notes'  # Replace with the path to your markdown files

def get_markdown_files(directory):
    """Get a list of markdown files from the given directory."""
    markdown_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.md'):
                markdown_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
    return markdown_files

def load_files_to_ollama(files):
    """Load markdown content into Ollama."""
    for file_path in files:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()
            filename = os.path.basename(file_path)

            # Prepare the data payload for the API
            payload = {
                'filename': filename,
                'content': content
            }
            
            # Send POST request to Ollama API
            response = requests.post(OLLAMA_API_URL, json=payload)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(f"Successfully ingested {filename}")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to ingest {filename}. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
                print(f"Response: {response.text}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Step 1: Get all markdown files
    md_files = get_markdown_files(NOTES_DIRECTORY)
    
    # Step 2: Load files into Ollama
    load_files_to_ollama(md_files)
```

### Explanation

- `**get_markdown_files(directory)**`: This function retrieves all markdown files (`.md`) from the specified directory, including any subdirectories.
- `**load_files_to_ollama(files)**`: This function opens each markdown file, reads its content, and sends a POST request to the Ollama API endpoint to ingest the content.
- `**OLLAMA_API_URL**`: Replace this with the actual endpoint that Ollama uses to receive the ingested content.
- `**NOTES_DIRECTORY**`: Replace with the full path to your Obsidian notes directory.

### Notes

- Make sure to handle any authentication needed by Ollama's API.
- If Ollama’s API requires a different payload format or headers, adjust the `requests.post()` call accordingly.
