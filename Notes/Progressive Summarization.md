# Progressive Summarization

**Progressive Summarization** is a [[Knowledge Management]] technique aimed at **refining notes** through multiple stages. With each pass, the content is distilled further, focusing on key takeaways and making the information more accessible for **long-term retention** and **quick retrieval**. Using AI tools can enhance this process by assisting with summarization, managing insights, and automating information retrieval.

---

## Purpose of Progressive Summarization

- **Simplify Complex Information**: Gradually condense content to highlight the most essential points.
- **Enhance Retrieval**: Make it easier to retrieve key information over time for study or reference.

## Stages of Progressive Summarization with AI Support

### 1. **Capture Stage: Ingesting Raw Information**

- Capture and store raw data efficiently with AI tools that extract information from large sources.
- **AI Tools**:
    - **Text Extraction**: Tools like **[[ChatGPT]]** or **Microsoft Copilot** for PDFs, articles, or media.
    - **Speech-to-Text AI**: Use **Otter.ai** or **Whisper** to transcribe meetings and lectures.
    - **Browser Extensions**: Tools like **Readwise** for collecting highlights into note systems.

### 2. **First-Layer Summary: Creating Quick Highlights**

- Create quick highlights by identifying key points in the material.
- **AI Tools**:
    - **ChatGPT** for bullet-point summaries.
    - **Extractive Summarization**: Use **OpenAI API** to automatically highlight key phrases.
    - **Keyword Extraction**: Tools like **MonkeyLearn** or **Hugging Face models**.

---

### 3. **Second-Layer Summary: Adding Context**

- Add personal insights or deeper understanding to the initial highlights.
- **AI Tools**:
    - **Idea Expansion**: Ask **ChatGPT** to elaborate on highlights or suggest related topics.
    - **Automatic Contextualization**: Obsidian plugins for creating backlinks between notes.
    - **Semantic Search**: Use tools like **Mem X** or **Glean** to surface related insights.

### 4. **Third-Layer Summary: Synthesis and Perspective**

- Incorporate your own insights and connections between ideas, with AI identifying patterns.
- **AI Tools**:
    - **[[Obsidian]] [[GPT]] Plugin**: Suggest connections and synthesis points between notes.
    - **Concept Mapping AI**: Tools like **Kumu** or **Scapple** to visualize relationships.
    - **Thematic Analysis**: Use **Large Language Models ([[LLM]]s)** to uncover emerging patterns.

---

### 5. **Distribution and Retrieval: Organizing Summaries**

- Organize refined summaries for easy retrieval using AI tools.
- **AI Tools**:
    - **Vector Search Engines**: Use **LlamaIndex** or **Pinecone** to create a searchable knowledge base.
    - **Chatbot Memory**: AI-powered assistants with **Obsidian** or **Notion** to answer questions based on notes.
    - **[[Spaced Repetition]]**: Tools like **Anki** or Obsidian plugins to schedule reviews for long-term retention.

## Workflow Example: Using Obsidian + ChatGPT for Progressive Summarization

1. **Capture**: Use tools like **Readwise** or **Whisper** to import content into Obsidian.
2. **First-Layer Summary**: Generate bullet-point summaries with ChatGPT.
3. **Add Context**: Review and add context using AI-powered insights.
4. **Synthesize**: Use Obsidian's GPT plugin for thematic connections between notes.
5. **Retrieve**: Employ vector or semantic search to quickly access related notes.
