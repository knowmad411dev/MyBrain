### **Definition**:

A **System** is a set of interconnected elements that interact to achieve a particular goal or perform a specific function. Systems can be found in nature, technology, organizations, and societies, and they function through the relationships and dependencies between their parts.

### **Key Characteristics**:

1. **Interconnectedness**: All parts of a system influence one another, forming a web of interactions.
2. **Purpose**: Every system operates with a purpose, whether it's maintaining stability, producing outputs, or achieving certain goals.
3. **Inputs and Outputs**: Systems take inputs, process them, and produce outputs.
4. **Feedback Loops**: Systems often contain **reinforcing** or **balancing** feedback loops that either amplify or stabilize system behaviors.
5. **Boundaries**: Systems have defined limits that separate them from the environment, though these boundaries can be flexible.

### **Types of Systems**:

- **Natural Systems**: Found in nature, such as ecosystems, weather patterns, or the human body.
- **Human-Made Systems**: Created by humans, including transportation networks, organizations, and software systems.
- **Social Systems**: Include societies, economies, and cultures, where individuals interact to form complex relationships.

### **Examples**:

- **Biological Systems**: The human body, with its organs and processes, functions as a complex system.
- **Ecological Systems**: Forests or coral reefs, where species interact with each other and their environment.
- **Technological Systems**: Computers, networks, and software systems that process information.

### **Applications**:

- **[[Problem Solving]]**: Understanding systems helps in diagnosing problems and designing effective solutions.
- **[[Systems Thinking]]**: A holistic approach to analyzing how parts of a system interact to influence overall behavior.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Systems Thinking]]**: A methodology for understanding the behavior of complex systems.
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms within systems that regulate and influence behavior.
