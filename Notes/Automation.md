## **Automation**

**Definition**: Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention, improving efficiency, reliability, and accuracy. It can be applied across various domains, including manufacturing, software development, data processing, and home systems.

**Benefits**:

- **Increased Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing labor costs.
- **Consistency**: Minimizes human error, ensuring tasks are performed consistently and accurately.
- **Scalability**: Allows processes to be easily scaled to meet increased demand without proportional increases in labor.

**Applications**: Automation is widely used in industries like automotive manufacturing (e.g., robotic assembly lines), IT (e.g., continuous integration and deployment), and [[Home]] systems (e.g., smart lighting or climate control).
