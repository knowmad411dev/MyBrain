## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of [[Artificial intelligence]] that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves the use of algorithms to process, understand, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful. NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks, including:

- **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined groups.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying key information (such as names, dates, and locations) in text.

NLP is used in various applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, language translation services, and voice recognition systems, making it an essential part of modern AI that helps bridge the gap between human communication and machines.
