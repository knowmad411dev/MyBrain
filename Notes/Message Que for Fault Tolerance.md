## **Message Queue for Fault Tolerance**

### **Overview**

A message queue is a crucial component for ensuring fault tolerance in systems by acting as an intermediary between the request handler and the database. It temporarily holds events, ensuring that no data is lost in case of failures or delays.

### **Key Components**

1. **Request Handler**: Receives and processes incoming requests.
2. **Message Queue**: Temporarily stores events to be processed, preventing loss during system failures or high load.
3. **Queue Consumers**: Processes the messages in the queue, ensuring data is eventually stored in the database.

### **Benefits**

- **Failure Recovery**: Ensures that events are not lost when system components fail, allowing recovery without data loss.
- **Load Buffering**: Manages bursts of high traffic by holding events in the queue and processing them as resources become available.
- **Scalability**: Improves the systemâ€™s ability to scale by decoupling components, allowing them to handle load independently.
