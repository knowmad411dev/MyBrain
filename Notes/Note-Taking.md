# Note-Taking Principles

The **Note-Taking Principles** developed by **Andy Matuschak** emphasize the transformation of note-taking from simple information storage to a dynamic system that actively supports **learning**, **thinking**, and **creativity**. Below are the core principles of Matuschak's approach:

---

## 1. **[[Evergreen Notes]]**

Evergreen notes are designed to be **durable** and **constantly evolving** in value. They are not fleeting or simple summaries but are meant to be continuously refined, interconnected, and relevant over time.

- **Atomic**: Each note focuses on a **single concept**.
- **Conceptual**: Each note stands independently, offering **valuable insight** without excessive context.
- **Linked**: Evergreen notes should be interconnected, forming a **web of ideas** that reveals patterns and enhances understanding.

## 2. **Notes as [[Thinking]] Tools**

Matuschak sees notes as **tools for thought**, not just storage. They are designed to actively foster **insights** and **connections** between ideas.

- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously revisited and refined.
- **Question-Driven**: Formulated around questions to encourage deeper exploration.

## 3. **Progressive Summarization**

This method involves **gradually condensing** information to highlight the most important insights over time:

1. **Highlight key insights**.
2. **Refine the highlights**, emphasizing critical points.
3. **Distill** the material into its core concepts.

## 4. **Linking Your Thinking**

Instead of strict hierarchies, Matuschak advocates for creating a **network of linked ideas**. This approach mimics how the brain processes information associatively:

- Surface **related ideas** when revisiting a note.
- Discover **unexpected connections** between concepts.

## 5. **Spaced Repetition & Active Recall**

Incorporating **spaced repetition** and **active recall** into the note-taking system helps solidify **long-term memory**:

- **Flashcards**: Convert evergreen notes into flashcards for regular review, enhancing retention.

## 6. **Note Templates & Prompts**

Matuschak encourages using **templates** and **prompts** to ensure structured and clear notes:

- **Claim-Evidence-Implications**: State a claim, provide evidence, and explore implications.
- **Question-Answer**: Frame notes as answers to questions for active engagement.

---

## 7. **Continual Note Revision**

Notes should remain **dynamic**, continuously revisited and updated:

- Add **new insights** and **connections** over time.
- Use existing notes to **inspire new ideas** or refine previous ones.

## 8. **Notes Are Never "Done"**

Notes are part of an ongoing process of **learning** and **thinking**. They should always be open to revision and reinterpretation, fostering continuous **growth** and **engagement**.

## Conclusion

Matuschak's note-taking principles transform notes into a **living system** that promotes growth, learning, and creativity, making them tools for continuous intellectual development.
