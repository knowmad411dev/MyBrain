## **LangChain Tutorial**

This video provides a comprehensive guide to the LangChain framework in seven steps, designed to help users build robust language model (LLM) applications. Here's an overview and breakdown of the video:

### Overview

The tutorial introduces the core concepts of LangChain, a framework for developing applications that utilize large language models (LLMs). The creator promises to cover the fundamental components, walk viewers through coding examples, and build various chains and agents.

### Key Concepts and Structure

The video is structured to guide viewers through the following main steps:

#### Introduction to LangChain

- **What is LangChain?**: An open-source framework for developing LLM applications that integrates LLMs with external sources of computation and data.
- **Why Learn LangChain?**: LangChain enables you to harness LLMs to build sophisticated systems like chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and multi-agent applications.
- **Core of LangChain**: Primarily focuses on the core library, skipping over more advanced topics like LangGraph, LangSmith, and LangSurf.

#### LangChain Applications Overview

- **Chatbots**: Intelligent conversational agents for marketing, education, and customer support.
- **RAG Applications**: Systems that use LLMs with retrieval mechanisms to summarize documents, analyze data, and generate code.
- **Agent Systems**: Applications that build multi-agent systems or human-agent interactions for complex workflows.

#### Why LangChain is Important

- **Higher-Level Programming Paradigm**: LangChain facilitates transitioning to natural language programming, which allows LLMs to generate executable code based on natural language prompts.
- **Advanced Agent Interactions**: LangGraph, an advanced LangChain component, enables complex multi-agent workflows and is increasingly being used in real-world applications like supply chain management and operations.

#### Setting Up Development Environment

- **API Keys and Environment Variables**: The user needs to get API keys from their preferred LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and store them in an `.env` file.
- **Installing Necessary Libraries**: Install Python libraries like `python-dotenv` to fetch API keys, `langchain`, `langchain-community`, `openai`, and `anthropic`.
- **Running LLM Queries**: Example code is shown to run basic LLM queries using `ChatAnthropic` and GPT-4, demonstrating how to invoke the LLMs with prompts.

    ```Python
    # Example: Testing GPT-4 with a simple prompt
    response = llm.invoke("What is LangChain?")
    print(response)
    ```

#### Building Chains with Prompts and Loaders

- **What is a Chain?**: A chain is a sequence of interconnected components (prompts, LLMs, tools) that process a user's query and generate a valuable output (answer to a question, document summary, executable code, etc.).
- **Chain Components**:
    - **Prompt Templates**: Predefined instructions for guiding LLM responses.
    - **Loaders**: Tools to extract documents and metadata for input into chains.
- **Example Code for a Simple Chain**:

    ```Python
    from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
    
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["topic"],
        template="Tell me about {topic}."
    )
    
    # Use the prompt and LLM to create a chain
    chain = prompt_template | llm
    
    # Invoke the chain with input
    chain.invoke({"topic": "Python Programming"})
    ```

- **More Complex Chains**: Demonstrates transcribing YouTube videos using loaders and summarizing the content by injecting video transcripts into a prompt template.

#### LangChain Expression Language and Runnable Protocol

- **Chaining Runnables**: Components in LangChain are "runnables" and can be chained together using the pipe (`|`) operator.
- **Key Runnable Types**:
    - **Runnable Sequence**: Chains multiple runnable components sequentially.
    - **Runnable Lambda**: Wraps a Python function as a runnable component.
    - **Runnable Pass Through**: Passes data through unchanged or modifies it by adding keys.
    - **Runnable Parallel**: Runs multiple runnables concurrently.
- **Code Example Using Runnable Lambda**:

    ```Python
    # Wrap function as a Runnable Lambda
    length_func = lambda text: len(text)
    length_runnable = RunnableLambda(func=length_func)
    
    # Add to the chain
    chain_with_length = chain | length_runnable
    ```

#### Splitters and Retrievers for RAG Applications

- **Retrievers and Vector Stores**: Retrievers return relevant documents given a query. Vector stores like Redis can back retrievers for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) applications.
- **Text Splitters**: Break down documents into chunks for efficient retrieval.
- **Setting Up Redis Vector Store**:

    ```Python
    from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import RedisVectorStore
    
    # Set up Hugging Face embeddings
    embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
    
    # Create and use Redis Vector Store
    vector_store = RedisVectorStore(
        documents=chunked_documents,
        embeddings=embeddings,
        index_name="my_index"
    )
    
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()
    ```

- **Building a RAG Chain**: The retrieved context is sent along with the user query to the LLM to produce a contextual response.

#### Tools and Toolkits

- **What are Tools?**: Interfaces that allow chains or agents to interact with external sources, like APIs or computational resources.
- **Using Tools in Chains and Agents**: Tools can be directly executed or bound to LLMs.
- **Example Using a YouTube Search Tool**:

    ```Python
    from langchain_community.tools import YouTubeSearchTool
    
    youtube_tool = YouTubeSearchTool()
    result = youtube_tool.run("LangChain tutorial")
    ```

#### Building Agents with Tools

- **What are Agents?**: Agents are more dynamic than chains. They decide which actions to take or tools to use based on LLM reasoning.
- **Example of a YouTube Summary Agent**:
    - Create a `YouTubeSearchTool` and a transcript tool.
    - Bind them to an agent using a premade prompt template and `AgentExecutor`.

        ```Python
        from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_tool_calling_agent
        
        agent = create_tool_calling_agent(
            llm=llm,
            tools=[youtube_tool, transcript_tool],
            prompt=agent_prompt
        )
        
        # Run the agent with a query
        response = agent.invoke("Find and summarize LangChain videos")
        ```

### Conclusion and Next Steps

The video suggests diving into advanced tutorials to build more complex LangChain applications. It emphasizes the importance of control over retrievers for optimizing chatbot conversion rates and user experience.

This summary captures the major points, concepts, and code snippets covered in the video for learning and working with LangChain effectively.
