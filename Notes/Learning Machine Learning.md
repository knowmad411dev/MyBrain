## **Learning Machine Learning

- **Step 1: Start with Python Basics**
    - Learn basic Python programming (lists, dictionaries, if-else statements, loops).
    - Understand list comprehensions and class inheritance for a strong foundation.
- **Step 2: Math Fundamentals**
    - Cover essential math topics like calculus, linear algebra, and probability.
    - Focus on high school or entry-level college math, which is enough for ML basics.
- **Step 3: ML Developer Stack**
    - Learn basic ML tools like Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
    - Familiarize yourself with basic libraries as they form the foundation for ML projects.
- **Step 4: Introductory ML and DL Courses**
    - Start with Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization for fundamental ML concepts and tools (like scikit-learn and TensorFlow).
    - Optionally follow up with Andrej Karpathy’s Neural Network series for deeper insights into neural networks and math.
- **Step 5: Advanced ML Concepts**
    - Progress to the Deep Learning Specialization, which emphasizes neural networks and includes practical implementations using Hugging Face for NLP.
- **Step 6: Hands-On Projects**
    - Apply skills by working on real projects: start with Kaggle challenges for practical experience.
    - Reimplement research papers to solidify knowledge and stand out in job applications.
- **Tip: Active Learning Approach**
    - Code along with tutorials, start small, and gradually tackle more complex problems to build confidence and skill.

These steps aim to help ML learners structure their journey from Python basics to real-world applications, emphasizing hands-on learning at each stage.
