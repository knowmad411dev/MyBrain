## Creative [[Problem Solving]]

**Creative Problem Solving (CPS)** is a process that combines **creative thinking** with structured problem-solving methods to generate innovative solutions. Unlike traditional problem-solving, CPS encourages looking beyond conventional approaches, using techniques that foster **out-of-the-box thinking** and exploring multiple possibilities. CPS is commonly applied in fields requiring innovation, adaptability, and fresh perspectives, including business, science, and personal development.
