## **Bolt Local

## Overview of Setting Up Bolt Locally for Free Website Generation

In this guide, we'll explore a new way to access and use Bol, a powerful AI tool, locally for free. Bol can generate websites, build AI-powered SEO tools, and do much more. The process is straightforward, and you don't need to pay for an API to get started. Let's go through the step-by-step setup instructions and see some code examples.

### Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting Up Bol Locally

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**

    - Start by accessing the GitHub page for Bol. The repository was recently updated, and setting it up is simple. To begin, clone the repository using the command:

        ```
        git clone <repository-url>
        ```

    - Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal:

        ```
        cd bol-local
        ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    - Use the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages:

        ```
        npm install
        ```

    - Once installed, you need to install the project with:

        ```
        npm run install
        ```

3. **Edit the Environment File**

    - Open the environment file to configure API keys. Use Nano or any text editor to edit the `.env` file:

        ```
        nano .env
        ```

    - In the `.env` file, insert the API keys. If you need access to a free API, you can use services like **AI Studio** to create a free API key or access APIs from the GitHub Marketplace.
    - Save and exit the editor by pressing `CTRL + O` (to save) and `CTRL + X` (to exit).

4. **Run Bol Locally**

    - Once the environment file is configured, run Bol locally using the following command:

        ```
        npm run dev
        ```

    - This command will start the local server, and you should see a message indicating that Bol is up and running.

5. **Selecting and Using APIs**

    - After the server is running, you can choose which API to use for generating websites. If you encounter an error indicating that the API key is not set properly, go back to the `.env` file and ensure the API key is correctly configured.

### Example Usage: Creating a Website

To create a new website using Bol, follow these simple steps:

1. **Website Creation Prompt**

    - Once Bol is running locally, you can use prompts to generate websites. For example, use the following prompt:

        ```
        Create a website for an SEO training service in Birmingham.
        ```

    - Bol will generate the initial version of the website, including a homepage and any other necessary pages.

2. **Improving the Design**

    - If you want to improve the design, you can provide a prompt like:

        ```
        Improve the design of the homepage.
        ```

    - Bol will make changes based on your feedback, allowing you to iterate on the design until you're satisfied.

3. **Content Creation and Publishing**

    - To add more content, you can use prompts such as:

        ```
        Add content for SEO training in Birmingham, including services offered and benefits.
        ```

    - Bol will generate the content, which you can further edit if needed.

4. **Deploying the Website**

    - Once the website is ready, you can deploy it. Bol allows you to push the code to GitHub. Use the following steps:
        - **Push to GitHub**:

            ```
            git add .
            git commit -m "Initial website version"
            git push origin main
            ```

        - You can then host the website using services like **Netlify**. In Netlify, link the repository to set up continuous deployment.
        - **Netlify Deployment**:
            - Go to the Netlify dashboard.
            - Click on "Site Configuration" and then "Continuous Deployment."
            - Link the GitHub repository to automatically deploy changes whenever you push to GitHub.

### Using Different APIs with Bolt

One of the powerful features of Bol is the ability to choose between different APIs for different tasks.

- **Google API (Free)**: Use the Google API for basic website generation tasks. This API is free and great for getting started.
- **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 (Paid)**: For more advanced website creation, you can use the paid version of the API. To do this, switch the API settings in Bol to use **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and run:

    ```
    npm run dev --api=claude
    ```

- Bol also provides options to **download code**, **sync files**, **toggle the terminal**, and **push to GitHub** directly from the interface, making it easy to manage the project.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **API Key Issues**: If you see an error indicating that the API key is not set correctly, reopen the `.env` file and double-check your API key.
- **Preview Not Showing**: Sometimes, the preview might not display correctly. If this happens, use a prompt like:

    ```
    The preview is blank; can you make sure the preview works?
    ```

    Bol will troubleshoot the issue and provide a solution.

### Example: Building an SEO Website

- To demonstrate the full capability of Bol, you can create an **Enterprise SEO ROI Calculator** website.
- Once the calculator is built, you can use **Netlify** to host it and link it to your GitHub repository. The locally hosted version gives you more control over which APIs to use, unlike the online version which may restrict API choices.
- The final output can be pushed to GitHub, and you can publish the website directly from there.

### Summary

Bol provides a powerful way to create and manage websites locally for free, using various APIs. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can:

- Set up Bol locally.
- Generate websites and build SEO tools.
- Deploy your projects using GitHub and Netlify.

Using Bol locally allows you to save significantly on hosting and API costs, making it a cost-effective solution for web development. Whether you are just getting started or looking for advanced features, Bol offers a versatile set of tools for developers.
