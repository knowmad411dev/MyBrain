## **Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight, easy-to-read and write markup language used to format text. Created by John Gruber in 2004, it allows users to convert plain text into formatted text for the web. Markdown is commonly used in documentation, blogs, and readme files, especially on platforms like [[GitHub]].

Because it's plain text, Markdown is platform-independent and can be rendered into HTML for web use. It is widely used by developers, writers, and content creators for its simplicity and ease of use.
