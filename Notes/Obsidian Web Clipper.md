## **Obsidian Web Clipper

### Summary of Obsidian Web Clipper Video

The video covers the installation, configuration, templates, and common use cases for the Obsidian Web Clipper. Hereâ€™s a detailed summary including how-to instructions:

#### Installation and Configuration

1. **Installation**: The Obsidian Web Clipper is a browser extension, not an Obsidian plugin. To install, navigate to the Obsidian Clipper website and add the extension to your browser (e.g., click "Add to Edge" if using Microsoft Edge). Once installed, you can manage it through the browser's extension settings.
2. **Configuration**: To set up the Web Clipper with your Obsidian vault:

    - Click the extension icon and then the gear icon to access settings.
    - Under **General**, define which vault(s) to use. The clipper will default to the currently open vault if none are specified.
    - Set hotkeys for quick actions: **ALT+SHIFT+O** for quick clipping, and **ALT+H** for toggling the highlighter mode.
    - Advanced settings include options to control whether new clippings are automatically opened in Obsidian, compatibility with older versions, and importing/exporting settings.

#### Templates and Use Cases

3. **Templates**: Templates are used to control how web clippings are saved in Obsidian.

    - The clipper comes with a **default template** but allows custom templates for flexibility.
    - Templates must have a unique name and can be configured for different actions (e.g., create a new note, add to existing note, add to daily note).
    - Variables can be used in templates for note names, note location, and properties. For example, the "title" variable can use the web page's title as the note name.

4. **Custom Templates and Triggers**: You can set specific templates to be used automatically for certain websites by creating **template triggers** based on URL patterns. This is useful for frequently used sites like YouTube or Reddit.

#### Clipping Content

5. **Clipping a Web Page**:

    - To clip an article, click the extension icon, select the template, and choose the target vault or folder. You can use the highlighter mode to only clip selected parts of the page.
    - Alternatively, use the hotkey **ALT+H** to activate the highlighter and clip only the selected text.
    - To add the article's URL instead of the full content, create a custom template called "URL" that adds the URL to a specific note (e.g., "URLs to check").

6. **Using Custom Templates for Different Websites**:

    - For YouTube videos, create a **YouTube template** with a trigger for URLs starting with "https://youtube.com/watch". This ensures the clipper automatically uses the correct template for YouTube links.
    - For Reddit posts, create a **Reddit template** that clips the post content and metadata. Set the Reddit URL pattern as a trigger for this template.

#### Advanced Features and Common Use Cases

7. **Managing Properties and Highlights**:

    - Define properties for templates, such as tags or custom fields. The **highlighter mode** allows clipping only specific parts of a webpage, and you can export highlights to a single file.

8. **Five Common Use Cases**:

    - **Clipping Full Articles**: Clip full content including metadata and images.
    - **Clipping Highlights**: Activate highlighter mode to clip selected text or sections.
    - **Saving URLs**: Use a custom template to save article URLs for later reference.
    - **YouTube Videos**: Clip video information along with the embedded link.
    - **Reddit Posts**: Clip Reddit posts with metadata and images.
