## **Stereotypes

**Stereotypes** are widely held but oversimplified beliefs or assumptions about a particular group of people based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or profession. They can be both positive and negative but often lead to prejudice and biased behavior. Stereotypes simplify complex human attributes, contributing to unfair generalizations and reinforcing social inequalities.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Oversimplification:** Reduces individuality to a set of traits.
- **Bias and Prejudice:** Often perpetuate discrimination and unequal treatment.
- **Social Impact:** Affects how groups are perceived and treated in society.
