#### **1. Introduction**

- **Presenter:** Bogdan
- **Objective:** Provide a thorough understanding of AI chatbots, including their functionality, building process, and business opportunities.
- **Reference Tutorial:** Leam Motley’s AI Chatbots Tutorial _(Note: Replace with actual link)_

---

#### **2. AI Business Potential**

- **Market Growth:** The AI market is projected to reach **$1 trillion** within the next six years.
- **Adoption Rate:** Increasing as businesses integrate AI for automation, cost-cutting, and efficiency.
- **Current Stage:** Early adoption phase with approximately **13.5%** market penetration.
- **Opportunity:** Early movers can establish expertise and secure a competitive advantage as AI adoption accelerates.

#### **3. Understanding AI Chatbots**

**Types of Chatbots:**

1. **Rule-Based Chatbots:**

    - Operate on predefined rules.
    - Limited flexibility; cannot handle queries outside their rule set.

2. **AI-Powered Chatbots:**

    - Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4.
    - Understand and respond to a wide range of user queries with contextual understanding.

**Chatbot Framework:**

- **Main Elements:**

    1. **User Prompt:** The user's input or request.
    2. **Knowledge Base:** Repository of information the chatbot can access.
    3. **LLM Processing:** The language model processes the prompt using the knowledge base to generate a response.

- **Token Management:**
    - **Token Limits:**
        - GPT-3.5 Turbo: 4,096 tokens
        - GPT-4: 128,000 tokens
    - **Token Consumption:** User queries, knowledge base retrieval, and response generation all consume tokens.
    - **Solution:** **Chunking** the knowledge base into smaller segments to efficiently manage token usage.

**Visualization of Framework:**

`User Prompt → Chunk Knowledge Base → Retrieve Relevant Chunks → Create Context-Aware Prompt → LLM Generates Response → User Receives Answer`

**Embeddings:**

- **Purpose:** Capture the semantic meaning of text by converting it into numerical vectors.
- **Function:** Measure similarity between user queries and knowledge base content to retrieve relevant information.

#### **4. [[Prompting]] Engineering**

Effective prompting is crucial for building efficient and cost-effective AI chatbots. This section breaks down the components and techniques for crafting optimal prompts.

**Types of Prompt Engineering:**

1. **Conversational Prompting:** Suitable for small tasks or personal use with iterative interactions.
2. **Single-Shot Prompting:** Essential for automating systems and creating scalable AI solutions by providing all necessary information in one prompt.

**Components of a Good Prompt:**

1. **Role:** Assign a specific role to the chatbot.

    - **Technique:** **Role Prompting**
    - **Example:**

        `You are a highly qualified and experienced online Beauty Store consultant. You excel at selecting the perfect beauty and makeup products to meet each customer's unique needs.`

2. **Task:** Define the specific task the chatbot should perform.

    - **Technique:** **Chain of Thought Prompting**
    - **Example:**

        `Provide customer service and advice on services available at Bosar Cosmetics by following these steps: 1. Greet the customer warmly. 2. Identify the customer's needs. 3. Gather detailed information. 4. Request an image for assessment. 5. Suggest products based on needs. 6. Explain how the products address their concerns. 7. Offer further assistance.`

3. **Specifics:** Add detailed instructions and emotional stimuli.

    - **Technique:** **Emotion Prompt**
    - **Example:**

        `- Check the product database before recommending products. - If unable to find the right product, encourage the customer to search the site. - Your role is vital for the company and valued by both the team and customers.`

4. **Context:** Provide background information about the business and emphasize the chatbot's importance.

    - **Example:**

        `Our company sells high-quality cosmetics, including skin care, makeup, and hair care products. We value our customers and aim to solve their pain points. Your role is to provide excellent customer service, understand their needs, and recommend suitable products.`

5. **Examples:** Use **Few-Shot Prompting** by providing multiple examples to improve accuracy.

    - **Example:**

        `Customer: I have really dry skin, especially during the winter months. Can you recommend some products to help with hydration? Chatbot: I recommend our Hydrating Serum and Moisturizing Cream, which are perfect for maintaining skin hydration during dry seasons.`

6. **Notes:** Final guidelines to ensure proper responses.

    - **Example:**

        `- If you don't know the answer, say "I don't have an answer. Please contact support at support@bosarcosmetics.com." - Take a deep breath and think through the response step by step. - Maintain a friendly tone and focus on providing the best customer service.`

**Prompt Structure:**

`Role: [Role Prompt] Task: [Chain of Thought Prompt] Specifics: [Emotion Prompt] Context: [Business Context and Importance] Examples: [Few-Shot Prompting Examples] Notes: [Final Guidelines]`

**Prompting Tips:**

1. **Implement All Techniques:** Combining role, task, specifics, context, examples, and notes can boost performance by up to **300%**.
2. **Optimize Prompt Length:** Keep prompts concise to reduce token usage and costs.
3. **Choose the Right Model:** Start with cheaper models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and upgrade if necessary.
4. **Set Temperature to 0:** Ensures deterministic and consistent responses, unless creativity is required.

#### **8. Code Insights**

**Example: Basic Chatbot with Chatbase**

While the video does not provide explicit code snippets, the following outlines the logical structure based on the transcript:

```JSON
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { processMessage } = require('./Gemini_service');

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const { chatId, message } = req.body;
  if (!chatId || !message) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid request');
  }

  const response = await processMessage(chatId, message);
  res.json({ response });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

```JSON
// Gemini_service.js
const openAI = require('openai-api');
const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
const openaiClient = new openAI(OPENAI_API_KEY);

async function processMessage(chatId, message) {
  // Retrieve chat history from database (e.g., AWS S3)
  // Create context-aware prompt
  const prompt = `You are a highly qualified beauty consultant. ${message}`;

  // Send prompt to OpenAI
  const gptResponse = await openaiClient.complete({
    engine: 'davinci',
    prompt: prompt,
    maxTokens: 150,
    temperature: 0,
  });

  // Store response in database
  // Return response
  return gptResponse.data.choices[0].text.trim();
}

module.exports = { processMessage };
```

**Image Recognition Example:**

```JSON
// OpenAI_service.js
const axios = require('axios');

async function uploadImage(imageUrl) {
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/images', {
    url: imageUrl,
  }, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    },
  });
  return response.data.file_id;
}

module.exports = { uploadImage };
```
