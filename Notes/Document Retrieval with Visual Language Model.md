## **Overview of Document Retrieval - Visual Language Model (CoPoly)**

**Introduction to Document Retrieval**
Document retrieval is about matching user queries with relevant documents from a corpus. Traditional approaches rely on text-based retrieval methods like TF-IDF or BM25, which are effective for string matching but lack semantic understanding, especially in multimodal contexts. The growing complexity of documents that include text, images, tables, and charts requires more sophisticated retrieval techniques. CoPoly is introduced as a state-of-the-art solution leveraging vision-language models to address these needs.

**Challenges in Traditional Document Retrieval**
Traditional document retrieval systems face challenges like:
1. **Limited to Textual Elements**: They primarily work well with text-based documents but fail to effectively process multimodal documents containing images, charts, or infographics.
2. **Performance vs. Scalability Trade-off**: Balancing retrieval performance with scalability in real-world applications is complex, especially with documents having intricate layouts.
3. **Complex Pipelines**: Traditional systems often involve multiple tedious steps like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), layout detection, and image captioning, leading to inefficiencies and errors.

**Vision Language Models for Retrieval**
With the advent of Vision Language Models, document retrieval has become more efficient by combining both textual and visual elements into a unified architecture. Traditional OCR-based methods attempt to extract text and generate captions for images but fall short of seamlessly integrating visual features. Vision Language Models, like CoPoly, solve this by taking an end-to-end approach to document processing, integrating visual understanding inherently.

**Introduction to CoPoly**
CoPoly is an advanced document retrieval technique combining two models—CoBERT (for late interaction) and PolyGama (a vision-language model from Google). The model works by transforming each document page into an image, processing it directly rather than using separate OCR and text conversion processes. This approach extracts and indexes visual features for effective and efficient document matching.

CoPoly focuses on optimizing retrieval for visually rich documents, handling both text and images without separating them into distinct pipelines, as is common in more traditional methods.

**Architecture Overview of CoPoly**
1. **Input Conversion**: The first step involves converting each document page into an image. No text-based extraction is performed initially.
2. **Page Splitting into Patches**: Each page is divided into smaller 30x30 pixel patches. Each patch is then vectorized using a vision encoder.
3. **Vision Encoder and Projection Layers**: These patches are processed by a vision encoder to produce embeddings (representing features of each patch). These embeddings are projected to a suitable dimension for feeding into a language model (LLM).
4. **Late Interaction Mechanism**: The embeddings go through a late interaction mechanism to ensure efficient query matching.
5. **Embedding Storage and Comparison**: Finally, the generated embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient comparison during retrieval.

The main retrieval output is an image page matching the query rather than plain text, making it particularly useful for documents that need a combined analysis of visual and textual features.

**Comparison: CoPoly vs Traditional Approaches**
- **Traditional Retrieval**: Traditional approaches need OCR, layout detection, chunking, and vector embedding—all these steps add latency and complexity.
- **CoPoly Efficiency**: In contrast, CoPoly avoids intermediate steps by directly converting pages to images and working with visual-language embeddings. This drastically reduces the processing complexity, and as shown in performance metrics, CoPoly achieves faster processing time compared to OCR-heavy traditional methods (3.9 seconds versus 7 seconds per page, with significantly lower latency).

**How to Use CoPoly for Document Retrieval**

1. **Convert Documents to Images**: Convert each document or PDF page to an image, as CoPoly works primarily with images for its document retrieval mechanism.
2. **Divide Pages into Patches**: Divide each page into smaller image patches (e.g., 30x30 pixels) for easier processing.
3. **Run Patches Through a Vision Encoder**: Feed these image patches into a vision encoder to produce vectors that contain visual and semantic information from the document.
4. **Projection and Reduction**: Pass the vector embeddings through projection layers to normalize and reduce dimensionality, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval.
5. **Store in Vector Database**: Store these processed vectors in a vector database for efficient lookup.
6. **Query Processing**: When a query is submitted, it is also converted into vectors via the vision encoder. The query embeddings are compared against document embeddings to determine the most relevant documents.
7. **Return Image Results**: The retrieved results are presented as images of the relevant pages, which can then be processed further for exact answers if necessary.

**Code Example Summary**
The provided transcript did not contain specific code examples, but the general implementation would involve:
1. **Image Conversion**: Using a Python library like PyMuPDF to convert PDF pages to images.
   ```python
   import fitz  # PyMuPDF
   doc = fitz.open("document.pdf")
   for page_num in range(len(doc)):
       page = doc.load_page(page_num)
       pix = page.get_pixmap()
       pix.save(f"page_{page_num}.png")
   ```
2. **Image Patch Splitting**: Dividing an image into smaller patches using a library like OpenCV.
   ```python
   import cv2
   img = cv2.imread('page_0.png')
   patches = []
   patch_size = 30
   for y in range(0, img.shape[0], patch_size):
       for x in range(0, img.shape[1], patch_size):
           patches.append(img[y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size])
   ```
3. **Vision Encoding**: Using a pre-trained model to extract embeddings (e.g., a Vision Transformer or CLIP).
   ```python
   import torch
   from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
   
   model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch16")
   processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch16")
   
   inputs = processor(images=patches, return_tensors="pt")
   outputs = model.get_image_features(**inputs)
   ```
4. **Embedding Storage**: Storing vectors in a vector database like FAISS or Chroma.

**Key Takeaways**
1. **CoPoly** is a highly efficient, multimodal document retrieval approach that integrates both visual and textual features for effective search and indexing.
2. **Visual Patch Encoding**: By splitting pages into small image patches and using vision encoders, CoPoly can extract semantic meaning from both visual and textual elements.
3. **End-to-End Model**: CoPoly skips intermediate OCR and layout steps, making the process faster and more suitable for complex, visually-rich documents.

In the next session, more details will be provided on the indexing process, specific components like the projection layer, Gamma 2B processing, and the query phase. The architecture of an end-to-end document retrieval system, including CoPoly, will also be discussed.
