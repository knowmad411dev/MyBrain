## **Neural Networks**

Neural Networks are a set of algorithms inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process input data, extract features, and produce an output. Neural networks are the backbone of many modern machine learning systems and are particularly powerful for:

- **Image Recognition**: Identifying and classifying images with high accuracy.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text.
- **[[Natural Language Processing]]**: Understanding and generating human language.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data.

Neural networks can be classified into several types, including:

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**: The simplest type, where information moves in one direction from input to output.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images, making them ideal for computer vision tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language, enabling the network to retain information from previous steps.

Neural networks are fundamental to deep learning and are widely used in applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and predictive analytics
