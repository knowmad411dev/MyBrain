## **ChatGPT**

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, designed to understand and generate human-like text based on prompts provided by users. It uses deep learning and [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) techniques, trained on a vast corpus of internet text data to engage in conversation, answer questions, provide explanations, and assist with creative or technical tasks.

**Key Features**:

- Generates coherent, context-aware responses in real-time.
- Capable of assisting with a wide range of subjects and tasks, including programming, writing, brainstorming, and answering questions.
- Can adapt to a conversational style, making it suitable for interactive applications.

**Use Cases**:

- Personal assistance: scheduling, note-taking, reminders.
- Creative collaboration: writing, brainstorming, and storytelling.
- Learning and tutoring: explaining complex concepts or helping with education.

**Limitations**:

- Sometimes produces plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.
- Limited by the information it was trained on (up to September 2021 for older models).
- Does not have real-time internet access unless connected to specific plugins or tools.
