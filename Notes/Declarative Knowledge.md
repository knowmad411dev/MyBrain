## **Declarative Knowledge

**Definition**:
Declarative [[Knowledge]], or "knowing what," refers to the understanding of facts, concepts, and information that can be explicitly stated. It involves knowledge about "what" something is, "why" it is important, or "how" it works, and it can be easily communicated, documented, and shared.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Explicit**: Can be clearly articulated, described, and written down.
- **Fact-Based**: Involves facts, principles, theories, and general information.
- **Organized**: Often structured in a way that makes it easy to store, retrieve, and share.
- **Cognitive**: Stored in the memory and can be consciously accessed.

**Examples**:

- Knowing that Paris is the capital of France.
- Understanding the theory of gravity.
- Remembering historical dates and events.
- Learning the definitions of words.

**Related Concepts**:

- **Procedural Knowledge**: Knowing how to perform tasks (e.g., riding a bike).
- **[[Explicit Knowledge]]**: Similar to declarative knowledge, as both can be expressed clearly.
- **Semantic Memory**: The part of long-term memory that stores declarative knowledge.

**Use Cases**:

- **Education**: Declarative knowledge is often the focus of traditional learning, such as studying subjects like history, science, and language.
- **Knowledge Management**: Essential for creating documents, reports, manuals, and databases.
