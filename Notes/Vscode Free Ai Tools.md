**Title: Free Coding Assistant Tools for VS Code: Copilot Arena and AI Toolkit**

### Overview

This text introduces two free tools for **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** that serve as coding assistants: **Copilot Arena** and **AI Toolkit**. These tools provide powerful features, including code completion, model comparison, and integration with various large language models, all within the VS Code environment. Below is a detailed overview of these tools, how to install them, and when to use each.

### 1. Copilot Arena: Free Code Completion in VS Code

**Copilot Arena** is an open-source code completion tool for VS Code that provides advanced code suggestions similar to popular paid services. Here are the key features and setup instructions:

#### Features

- **Multiple Models for Code Completion**: You can use several models like **GB40**, **Codol**, **L3.1**, **Quinn**, and **Sonet 3.5**.
- **Advanced Code Suggestions**: Copilot Arena can auto-complete your code with context-aware suggestions. It allows you to select the best result from different models, making it feel like a competition between AI models.
- **Private Mode**: The extension allows users to control whether their code is used for training AI models. By default, Copilot Arena collects code for research purposes, but this can be changed to keep your code private.

#### Installation and Configuration

1. **Install Copilot Arena**:
   - Open VS Code, go to the **Extensions** tab, and search for "Copilot Arena".
   - Click **Install** to add it to your editor.
2. **Configure Privacy Settings**:
   - Click the **Manage** button (gear icon) next to Copilot Arena in the Extensions tab.
   - Go to **Settings**, and under "Code Privacy Settings," change from **Research** to **Private** to ensure that your code is not uploaded for AI training purposes.

#### Usage

- **Auto-completion**: Start coding, and Copilot Arena will offer suggestions automatically. You can use **Tab** to accept the suggestion.
- **Model Selection**: When multiple suggestions are available, you can choose which one to accept by pressing **Control + 1** for the first option, **Control + 2** for the second, and so on.
- **Prompt Enhancements**: Select a block of code and press **Control + I** (or **Command + I** on macOS) to get enhanced suggestions or modifications based on the selected code.
- **Example**: While migrating a project from VB to JavaScript, Copilot Arena provided two different autocompletion options for a function, allowing the user to choose the better version. The extension made it easy to iterate through suggestions quickly.

### 2. AI Toolkit: A Versatile AI Integration by Microsoft

**AI Toolkit** is an official Microsoft extension that integrates AI features into VS Code. It provides access to a wide range of AI models, allowing you to experiment with different assistants for coding tasks.

#### Features

- **Model Catalog**: Access a large variety of models hosted by GitHub, **Anthropic**, **Google**, **OpenAI**, **Onnx**, and others.
- **Free Access to GPT-40 and Other Models**: The extension allows you to use several AI models, such as **GPT-40**, **Llama**, and **Cohere**, directly from within VS Code.
- **System Prompt Configuration**: You can set custom system prompts for the models, making it easy to tailor responses for specific coding tasks.

#### Installation and Configuration

1. **Install AI Toolkit**:
   - Go to the **Extensions** tab in VS Code and search for "AI Toolkit".
   - Click **Install** to add the extension to your editor.
2. **Open the Model Catalog**:
   - After installation, you will find a "Welcome" page in VS Code with an **Explore AI Models** button.
   - Click **Open Model Catalog** to see the available models and select the one you wish to use.

#### Usage

- **Model Selection**: You can choose models based on publisher, task type, or device type. For example, you can filter models hosted by GitHub or Google for specific tasks.
- **System Prompts**: You can add system prompts to customize the behavior of the AI. For example, a prompt could instruct the model to design a homepage for an airline website using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Example**: The user provided a prompt to design an airline website homepage, and GPT-40 generated a well-structured HTML layout with Tailwind CSS. The only drawback is that you need to copy and paste the generated code manually into your project.
- **Additional Models**: Besides GPT-40, you can also access other models like **Mr Large 2**, **Mistery Small**, **01 Preview**, and **01 Mini**. Some models require early access, but many are available for free.

### Choosing Between Copilot Arena and AI Toolkit

- **Copilot Arena**: Use Copilot Arena when you want **real-time code completion** and are working within the editor on a specific project. Its key strength is the ability to compare multiple autocompletions from different models and quickly choose the best one. It is also well-suited for projects that require context-aware completion for various programming languages.
- **AI Toolkit**: Use AI Toolkit when you want to **explore a variety of models** for different tasks or need an AI that can generate complete code solutions based on complex prompts. It is more versatile for trying out different models but requires manual copying of generated code.

### Conclusion

These free tools provide robust, integrated coding assistance within VS Code without requiring subscriptions. **Copilot Arena** offers seamless in-editor code completion, while **AI Toolkit** provides access to a wide range of models for different tasks. Together, these tools can significantly enhance productivity, giving developers the freedom to choose the best assistant for each situation.

If you're looking for a versatile, zero-cost coding assistant setup, these tools are excellent options to explore. Whether you want quick, inline completions or need more customized AI-generated code, Copilot Arena and AI Toolkit have you covered.
