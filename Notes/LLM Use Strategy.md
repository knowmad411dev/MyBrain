## **LLM Use Strategy

The video discusses the strategy of using large language models (LLMs) effectively and affordably, with a focus on running them locally versus paying per token through cloud-based services. Here's a breakdown of the content, covering the pros, cons, and a strategy to balance costs and efficiency.

### Summary Overview:

1. **LLMs and Hardware Requirements**:

    - Running local LLMs (like Llama 3.1) can be desirable for cost efficiency, data privacy, and scaling.
    - However, running powerful LLMs locally requires extremely powerful (and expensive) hardware, like GPUs costing upwards of $2,000.
    - Cloud GPU machines can be an alternative, but they cost around $1 per hour or more, leading to substantial expenses over time.
    - Therefore, without a significant initial investment, running local AI might not be realistic.
2. **Suggested Strategy**:

    - **Pay-Per-Token Approach**: Start by paying per token for an LLM via a third-party service. This avoids high upfront costs for hardware.
    - **Transition to Local Hosting**: Once you scale to a certain point, switch to hosting the LLM on your hardware, which becomes more affordable as your demand increases.
    - **Consistency of Model**: Since you're using the same model both when paying per token and when hosting locally, you avoid unintended consequences in your application from switching models.
3. **Using Groq for Cost-Effective LLM Hosting**:

    - **Groq Introduction**: Groq (accessible at [gro.com](https://gro.com)) is an AI service offering extremely cheap per-token inference for open-source LLMs. It also has a free tier suitable for lighter requirements.
    - The speaker clarifies that they are not sponsored by Groq but recommend it due to its speed and affordability.
4. **Demonstration of Groq’s Speed and Usability**:

    - On Groq’s website, there's a demo chat window to showcase speed, processing around 1,200 tokens per second (equivalent to ~1,000 words per second), which is faster than most LLMs.
    - **Simple Integration**:
        - **For Python & OpenAI API**: Simply replace the OpenAI base URL with the Groq API endpoint and add the Groq API key. Example code is provided:

            python

            Copy code

            `import openai openai.api_key = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY" openai.api_base = "https://api.groq.com/v1" # your existing OpenAI usage code follows`

            - **For LangChain**: A specialized package makes it even easier:

                shell

                Copy code

                `pip install langchain-groq`

                Set the API key as an environment variable, import the Groq instance in LangChain, and use it as you would normally with any LLM.

        - **For n8n Integration**: Groq is also supported natively in n8n workflows. Just add the Groq API key in the credentials, and it becomes accessible in workflow nodes for LLM operations.
5. **Pricing and Cost-Effectiveness of Groq**:

    - **Groq Pricing Example**: Running LLaMA 3.1 70b costs $0.59 per million tokens, translating to around 1.69 million tokens per dollar.
    - **Comparison**: Groq is cheaper than many closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.5) and even competitive with other services offering open-source LLMs, like Together.
    - **Note on Privacy**: While using Groq is better than using closed-source models regarding data privacy, it is still hosted by another company. For highly sensitive data, use mock data during prototyping until you switch to local hosting.
6. **Calculating When to Switch from Groq to Local Hosting**:

    - **Cost Analysis for Local Hosting**:
        - Consider the cost of running a GPU machine in the cloud. For example, using RunPod, an A40 GPU costs $0.39 per hour.
        - To calculate the monthly cost: `0.39 (per hour cost) * 24 (hours per day) * 30 (days per month) = $280/month`
    - **Determine the Token Break-Even Point**:
        - Calculate how many tokens you get per dollar on Groq (1.69 million tokens per dollar for LLaMA 3.1 70b).
        - Assume an average prompt size (e.g., 5,000 tokens). This will determine the number of prompts per dollar.
        - Compare the cost of using Groq (per-token pricing) with the cost of running your own GPU machine.
        - A "magic number" emerges when it becomes more cost-effective to run your LLM locally based on usage.
            - For example, if your app hits around 3,000 prompts per day, switching to a local setup may make financial sense.
7. **Conclusion**:

    - Groq’s pricing is competitive and can be used effectively for a long time, but eventually, the cost efficiency of hosting your LLM locally outweighs the pay-per-token model.
    - The video aims to provide practical guidance on when and how to transition from paying per token to self-hosting for cost savings and efficiency.

This summary should give a complete picture of the video content, providing context on how to leverage LLMs affordably and scale effectively over time.
