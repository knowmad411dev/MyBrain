# Basic Webhook Design

## Overview

A webhook is a mechanism for delivering real-time data between systems via HTTP requests. In a basic webhook design, the following key components are involved:

### Key Components

1. **Request Handler**

    - **Function:** Receives incoming HTTP requests containing event data.
    - **Role:** Acts as the initial point of contact, responsible for processing webhook events.
2. **Database**

    - **Function:** Stores event data and results.
    - **Role:** Ensures persistence by keeping a record of events, which can be used for further processing or auditing.

### Flaw in the Basic Design

- **Data Loss Risk:** Events may be lost if the request handler fails before successfully saving the data to the database.
    - **Scenario:** If the request handler crashes or encounters an error after receiving a webhook request but before writing the data to the database, the event is not recorded, leading to potential data loss.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Persistent Queueing Mechanism**

    - Add a **message queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS) between the request handler and the database.
    - **Purpose:** Ensure that events are durably stored until they are processed, reducing the risk of data loss.
2. **Retry Mechanism**

    - Implement a **retry policy** for failed database writes.
    - **Purpose:** Ensure that temporary issues (e.g., network failures) do not result in lost data.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**

    - Incorporate logging for all incoming requests and processing statuses.
    - **Purpose:** To have a trace of requests, enabling troubleshooting if a failure occurs.
4. **Failure Notifications**

    - Add a mechanism to notify system administrators or trigger alerts if saving data fails consistently.
    - **Purpose:** Reduce the time it takes to identify and address issues.
