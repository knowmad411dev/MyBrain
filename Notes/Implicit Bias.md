# Implicit Bias

**Implicit bias** refers to the unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, or assumptions that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions without our explicit awareness. These biases can influence behavior and judgments, often in ways that may not align with our conscious values or beliefs.

## Key Characteristics of Implicit Bias

- **Influences Behavior**: They affect how we perceive and interact with others, often in subtle ways.
- **Learned through Culture**: Implicit biases are shaped by societal norms, media representations, and personal experiences.
- **Contradict Conscious Beliefs**: You can hold implicit biases even if your conscious beliefs oppose them.
