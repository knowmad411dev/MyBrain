## **Intuitions about Consciousness

This text, presented by Annaka Harris, offers a thought-provoking exploration of the concept of consciousness and its role in our understanding of the universe. Here’s a detailed overview:

### **1. The Nature and Mystery of Consciousness**

Annaka Harris introduces the idea that consciousness is "everything"—everything we know and experience, encompassing all the ways we perceive reality. The central mystery she highlights is how non-conscious matter in the universe can become configured in a way that allows it to develop consciousness. This phenomenon implies that at some point, matter becomes capable of having a subjective experience—something it "feels like" to be that matter.

### **2. Challenging Intuitions About Consciousness**

Modern neuroscience challenges our intuitions about consciousness. The prevailing assumption is that consciousness arises from complex processing in the brain, but recent findings suggest we may have been conceptualizing it incorrectly. Harris proposes that consciousness might not be something that emerges only from biological complexity but could instead be a more fundamental feature of the universe, akin to gravity. This perspective implies that many natural systems, regardless of their complexity, could have some form of awareness or "felt experience."

### **3. The Definition of Consciousness**

Harris acknowledges that there is no perfect definition of consciousness, particularly in its fundamental sense. She draws on Thomas Nagel's famous essay "What is it Like to Be a Bat?" to illustrate how different conscious experiences can be. Nagel's bat uses sonar to navigate the world, which is vastly different from how humans use vision, yet both are conscious experiences. Harris defines consciousness not as higher-order thinking, complex thought, or self-reflection, but as basic awareness or sentience. This consciousness can exist without thought, as evidenced in very young children or simple organisms that have sensory experiences but are incapable of complex reasoning.

### **4. The Complexity of Conscious [[Systems]]**

Consciousness has often been studied through the lens of neuroscience, largely because the most evidently conscious beings are those with systems most similar to our own. Humans have the most complex nervous system known, so it's been assumed that complexity is necessary for consciousness. However, Harris argues that these assumptions might be misleading, as certain aspects of consciousness and behavior suggest otherwise.

### **5. Key Questions About [[Consciousness]]**

Harris identifies two important questions that challenge our traditional intuitions about consciousness:

1. **External Indicators of Consciousness**: Can we conclusively determine that an organism or system has conscious experiences by observing it from the outside? She illustrates the challenge with the example of Jean-Dominique Bauby, a man with "locked-in syndrome," who was fully conscious but unable to move or communicate except through the blinking of his left eyelid. Bauby wrote an entire memoir this way, providing a vivid example of a conscious being whose condition might not otherwise reveal any signs of awareness. This raises the possibility that other systems may have consciousness but lack the ability to express it in ways we recognize.
2. **The Role of Consciousness in Behavior**: Does consciousness serve a functional role in driving behavior? Harris uses the example of fear to illustrate how our conscious experience of emotions might not be as directly linked to behavior as we believe. Neuroscientific evidence shows that physiological responses to danger often precede conscious awareness, suggesting that consciousness might be more of an interpretive process rather than the direct driver of action.

### **6. [[Neuroscience]] Insights and Binding Processes**

Harris further explains how binding processes in the brain create the illusion of a cohesive present moment. For example, when pressing a piano key, the feeling of touch, the visual feedback, and the sound all reach the brain at different times, but the brain binds them together to create the perception of simultaneous experience. This highlights how our intuitions about the timing of consciousness and action can be deceptive.

### **7. Revisiting the Foundations of Consciousness**

Given that our assumptions about consciousness arising from complexity may be incorrect, Harris posits that we have two main hypotheses:

- **Consciousness arises from complexity**: Only some systems, like the human brain, reach the threshold of complexity needed to produce consciousness.
- **Consciousness is fundamental**: All systems might possess consciousness at a basic level, making it a ubiquitous aspect of nature.

These ideas lead to profound questions about how we could scientifically investigate such possibilities. For example, could experiences be shared between systems? Harris references Albert Einstein’s intuitions about space-time, which took him years to translate into something that could be communicated to others. She wonders if there might be a way in the future to directly share such intuitions, potentially transforming our understanding of knowledge and consciousness.

### **8. Ethical Implications and Broader Consciousness**

If consciousness is more pervasive in nature than we currently believe, it brings about important ethical questions. Harris touches on how we empathize with animals like dogs when they express pain. She invites the audience to consider whether other systems in nature—such as plants or other seemingly inert organisms—might also experience something akin to consciousness. During her plant research, she imagined that every plant on a hiking trail might have some form of consciousness, altering her perspective on the natural world.

### **9. Conclusion and Implications for Future Inquiry**

Annaka Harris ultimately encourages a more open-minded approach to studying and understanding consciousness. She suggests that instead of limiting the study of consciousness to neuroscience and complex systems, we should consider whether consciousness might be a fundamental aspect of all matter. By shifting our perspective, we may begin to see the world differently—one in which the boundaries of consciousness are not confined to creatures with complex brains but are spread more widely throughout the universe.

### **Engaging the Audience**

The text ends by encouraging readers to explore these ideas further by becoming a member of Big Think, suggesting a continuation of this intellectual journey.

### **Summary of Key Ideas**

- **Consciousness is central to our experience, yet its origins remain mysterious.**
- **Our intuitions about consciousness being exclusive to complex organisms may be wrong.**
- **Consciousness could be a fundamental property of nature, similar to gravity.**
- **We need new ways to think about and study consciousness scientifically.**
- **Understanding consciousness as more widespread could have profound ethical and philosophical implications.**

Overall, the text challenges conventional views on consciousness and invites readers to explore a deeper, more expansive understanding of what it means to be conscious. It encourages curiosity and openness to the possibility that consciousness is not limited to complex beings but may be a fundamental aspect of all reality.
