## **Code Editor

A **Code Editor** is a software tool specifically designed to create, edit, and manage source code. It offers features tailored for programming, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging support, and integration with version control systems. Code editors can be lightweight, like Neovim, or feature-rich integrated development environments (IDEs), like [[VSCode]]. They are essential tools for developers to efficiently write and maintain software code across various programming languages.
