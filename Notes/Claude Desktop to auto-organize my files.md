## **Claude Desktop to auto-organize my files

### **Overview of the mCP (Model Context Protocol)**

The mCP is a newly released open-source protocol by Anthropic that allows AI assistants, like Claude, to directly interact with user data across different environments. This development addresses the common issue where AI models are isolated from information silos, unable to access data beyond their app or chat interface. mCP aims to break these boundaries by allowing AI assistants to connect to repositories, business tools, development environments, and other systems where user data resides.

The main goals of the mCP are to:

1. Enable AI models to overcome the isolation of data.
2. Standardize the way developers connect AI tools to external systems.
3. Create a versatile method for interacting with various data sources.

The mCP is designed to be adaptable, with the ability to interface with a range of systems including file systems, GitHub, Google Drive, databases like Postgres, Slack, and even web scraping tools. This versatility makes it useful for developers and users who want to enhance their AI integrations.

### **How to Set Up mCP on Your Local Machine**

To begin using mCP, you need to follow a few simple steps to set up a local server and interact with it using Claude or another compatible AI model. Below, I provide a step-by-step guide.

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up mCP**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your computer. This will be used for setting up mCP, as it relies on Node.js for some server-side processing.
   - Have the **Claude desktop app** installed. This will be used to interact with mCP.

2. **Install and Configure mCP**:
   - You can run local mCP servers via the **Claude desktop app**. This allows you to communicate with a range of resources such as a file system, web server, or even local files.
   - Go to the **Anthropic GitHub page**. This repository contains all the "getting started" guides and documentation you need to understand how to run and set up mCP.
   - You'll find a section about different types of servers that can be used with mCP. The supported servers include:
     - **File System**: Allows interaction with local files.
     - **GitHub**: Interact with your GitHub repositories.
     - **Google Drive**: Access and manipulate files on Google Drive.
     - **Slack**: Send and receive messages through Slack.
     - **Postgres**: Access a Postgres database.

3. **Setting Up the File System Interaction**:
   - To work with your file system through Claude, you will need to add some configurations.
   - Locate the following directory on your system:
     ```
     /Users/<your-username>/Library/Application Support/Claude/
     ```
   - Create a new file called `claw_desktop_config.js`.
   - You can use a text editor (like **TextEdit** on macOS) to edit this file.

4. **Configuring `claw_desktop_config.js`**:
   - The configuration file will contain the settings needed to connect Claude to your file system. Here's a general example:
     ```json
     {
       "fileSystem": {
         "path": "/Users/<your-username>/Documents/",
         "permissions": "read-write"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Make sure to **replace `<your-username>`** with your actual username and adjust the `path` as needed to the directory you want Claude to access.
   - Save and close the file.

5. **Command-Line Alternative**:
   - Instead of using the GUI, you can also create and edit the configuration file directly through the terminal:
     ```bash
     touch ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claw_desktop_config.js
     nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claw_desktop_config.js
     ```
   - After editing, save the file using the key combination (`Ctrl + O` to write the changes and `Ctrl + X` to exit).

6. **Using mCP Features**:
   - Once you have configured mCP, open the **Claude app**. You will now see a new button labeled **"Attach from mCP"**.
   - Click on this button, and you will be able to see all the available tools mCP provides. These tools include:
     - **Create Directory**: Create a new folder.
     - **Get File Info**: Retrieve metadata about a file.
     - **List Directory**: List all the files within a directory.
     - **Move File**: Move a file to another directory.
     - **Read File**: Read the contents of a file.

### **Practical Example: Renaming and Reorganizing Files**

The walkthrough demonstrates using Claude and mCP to rename and organize a collection of medical documents in PDF format. Here’s how this use case was handled:

1. **Scenario**:
   - You have a folder called **`meddocs`** on your desktop containing multiple PDF files.
   - These files contain dates in varying formats, and you want to:
     - Rename each file with a consistent format.
     - Number them in chronological order based on the date in the file name.
     - Update the file name format so that the type of the report comes first (e.g., **"MRI report"**).

2. **Steps to Automate the Task**:
   - Claude is used to perform this task through mCP.
   - The prompt provided to Claude includes detailed instructions:
     - Specify the location of the folder.
     - Provide an example screenshot of the date formats.
     - State that the files should be numbered starting from the earliest date.
     - Define a consistent file naming format, like **"MRI report - [Date]"**.

3. **Processing by mCP**:
   - Claude analyzes the folder and reads the files' metadata.
   - It creates a plan to rename the files:
     - Extracts the dates, normalizes the formats, and assigns chronological numbers.
     - Standardizes the report names to match (e.g., all MRI reports are labeled consistently).
   - The task is carried out step by step:
     - Claude requests access permissions to the folder.
     - It reads the files, identifies any issues, and renames them accordingly.
   - During the process, Claude shows that it corrects itself as it proceeds, demonstrating self-monitoring capabilities.

4. **Result**:
   - All files were renamed correctly in chronological order.
   - The new naming format includes a number prefix, report type, and normalized date.
   - This task, which could take significant time if done manually, was completed efficiently by leveraging mCP.

### **Summary**

The **Model Context Protocol (mCP)** is a significant step toward breaking down barriers that limit how AI models can interact with data. It provides a universal standard to connect Claude and other AI assistants to real-world data sources like file systems, GitHub, and more. Here are the key takeaways and capabilities:

1. **Breaking Information Silos**: mCP allows for connecting models to diverse data sources, enabling richer interaction without manual input.
2. **Configurable Setup**: Users can configure their own environment by editing configuration files.
3. **Versatile Toolset**: mCP supports interacting with file systems, databases, Slack, web scraping, and more.
4. **Practical Use Case Demonstration**: Claude used mCP to rename and organize files, showing how AI can automate repetitive tasks by directly accessing the user's system.

### **Code and Configuration Examples**

1. **Example `claw_desktop_config.js` Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "fileSystem": {
       "path": "/Users/<your-username>/Documents/meddocs",
       "permissions": "read-write"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `<your-username>` with your system username.

2. **Terminal Commands for Creating Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   # Create and edit the claw_desktop_config.js file
   touch ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claw_desktop_config.js
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claw_desktop_config.js
   ```

   After editing, save using `Ctrl + O` and exit with `Ctrl + X`.

### **Conclusion**

The **mCP** protocol is a powerful tool that aims to make AI assistants more useful by enabling them to interact directly with local and remote data. Whether it’s renaming files, fetching data from Google Drive, or sending messages via Slack, mCP standardizes these interactions and expands the practical applications of AI systems.

The mCP's open-source approach also means that the community will contribute to and expand its capabilities, making it an exciting tool for developers and AI enthusiasts. While still in beta, it promises to reshape how we interact with AI in a more integrated and meaningful way, taking us beyond the confines of traditional, isolated chat interactions.
