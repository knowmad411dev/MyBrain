## **N8N 101 Automations in 2024

**Detailed Overview of n8n: A Guide to Automations and LLM Integration**

n8n is a powerful, easy-to-use automation platform, somewhat like an open-source alternative to platforms like Zapier. This guide provides a detailed breakdown of n8n, covering its installation, configuration, and practical use cases to create workflows, integrate Large Language Models (LLMs), and trigger actions using webhooks.

### Overview of n8n

n8n is designed to create automated workflows that connect apps and services—a great choice for developers wanting to create complex automation with minimal code. It integrates with popular services like Google Calendar, HubSpot, Slack, and supports custom APIs.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Stable Version**: Get the production version, specifically version **0.64**. Avoid version **0.66** as it has bugs. You can download it directly from the n8n installation docs.
2. **Running n8n**:
   - Run n8n using a package manager like `npx`. Example command:
     ```bash
     npx n8n
     ```
   - After running, open your browser to complete the setup by entering your **name** and **email**.

3. **Configuration Settings**:
   - After logging in, go to **Settings** to enter your license key. The license is free and gives access to extra features.

4. **Common Bugs**:
   - Ensure you use the stable version. Version **0.66** had several bugs, which required a rollback to **0.64**.

### Creating a Workflow in n8n

1. **Starting with Workflows**:
   - After logging in, you have an empty workspace to create workflows. A **workflow** in n8n is a series of nodes representing different automation steps.

2. **Basic Example: Form to LLM**:
   - **Manual Trigger or Form Trigger**:
     - You can choose a trigger like a **Manual Trigger** or a **Form Trigger**.
   - **Form Setup**:
     - Create a form with **no authentication**.
     - Set a **path** (e.g., `example1`) and a **title**.
     - Add a **text field**, set it as **required**, with a placeholder.

3. **Adding Actions**:
   - After the form is submitted, add a response message like “Thanks for the submission”.
   - Add an **LLM node** for integration.
   - Define a **system prompt** and **user prompt** for the LLM.
   - Example system prompt might look like:
     ```json
     {
       "prompt": "This is an example system prompt for the LLM to provide responses based on user input."
     }
     ```
   - Include the LLM response back into the form submission to make it interactive.

4. **Integrating a Webhook**:
   - **Webhook Response**:
     - Use a **webhook** to send back responses generated by the LLM.
     - The form receives the LLM’s response, returned to the user in **HTML format**.

### Example of Creating a Form Workflow with LLM Integration

#### Steps to Create the Workflow

1. **Add Trigger**:
   - Create a **form trigger**.
   - Configure the form:
     - **Path**: `/example1`
     - **Title**: `Sample LLM Workflow`
     - **Fields**:
       - Add a **text area**.
       - Set it as **required**.

2. **Form Submission Handling**:
   - Add a **response node** to thank the user for their submission.

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Add an **LLM node**.
   - Define the **system prompt** and **user prompt**.

4. **Setting Responses**:
   - Use a **webhook** to provide a response.
   - **Example of sending data back**:
     - Use HTML to provide structured responses.
     - Set the webhook to **expression mode** to handle dynamic content.

#### Example Code Block for Webhook Response

```javascript
{
  "response": {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "<html><body><h1>Response from LLM</h1><p>Your input was processed successfully!</p></body></html>"
  }
}
```

5. **Testing and Production**:
   - Test the entire workflow using the **Test** button.
   - Activate the workflow and use the **Production URL** to share the form publicly.

6. **Adding Extra Functionality**:
   - Add more fields to the form or new **system prompts**.
   - Examples include adding a **CSV upload feature** or extending LLM capabilities.

### Features Highlighted in the Example

1. **Ease of Setup**: The UI is easy to navigate, and workflows are simple to create.
2. **Dynamic Integration**: The n8n nodes allow integration between forms, LLMs, and various services.
3. **Structured Output**: Users can provide structured output using JSON and HTML, allowing interaction between nodes.
4. **Web-Based Interaction**: Webhooks create dynamic, interactive forms on the web.

### Advanced Use Cases Mentioned

- **AI Agents**: Integrate AI agents to add voice integrations.
- **Complex Automation**: Use n8n for tasks like **data scraping**, **voice automation**, and **AI agent triggers**.
- **Exploring Templates**: n8n allows you to explore pre-built templates, which are in **JSON** format, for easy copying and modification.

### Final Notes and Tips

- **Form-Based Automation**: The form template in n8n is a strong starting point for basic automation, LLM interactions, and webhooks.
- **Code Reduction**: Using n8n can significantly reduce the need for writing custom code by handling complex integration and automation tasks effectively.
- **Upcoming Learning**: Upcoming videos will cover advanced topics such as AI agent integrations and additional automation features.

### Conclusion

n8n is a versatile automation platform suitable for various automation tasks. Whether you're automating simple tasks like Google Calendar integration or creating complex workflows with LLMs or AI agents, n8n provides an accessible way to manage these automations without extensive code. The example presented demonstrates the power of using **form triggers**, **LLM nodes**, and **webhooks**, and shows how easy it is to get started with automating workflows in n8n.
