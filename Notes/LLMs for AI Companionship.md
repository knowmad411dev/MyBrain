## **LLMs for AI Companionship**

AI companions are not just a passing trend; they could become a $150 billion industry by 2030, [according to Ark Invest](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/is-ai-companionship-the-next-frontier-in-digital-entertainment). With the potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology and each other, AI companionship represents the next frontier in digital entertainment.

Popular companion apps like [Replika](https://replika.com/), [Gatebox](https://www.gatebox.ai/), [HeraHaven](https://herahaven.ai/), and [SoulMachines](https://soulmachines.com/) attract millions of users every month, based on Similarweb data.

If you’re considering building an AI companion, where do you start? Which large language model ([[LLM]]) should you choose to power your app? Let’s explore some of the best open-source LLMs and why they might be the right fit for your project.

## Choosing the Right LLM for AI Companionship

When building AI companions, one of the first decisions is selecting the appropriate open-source LLM. LLMs generally fall into three categories:

- **Base models**: Raw, unrefined versions trained on large datasets, but lacking task-specific fine-tuning.
- **Instruction-tuned models**: Refined to follow human instructions more accurately.
- **Chat-tuned models**: Optimized for conversational interactions, making them ideal for AI companionship.

## Why Chat-Tuned Models Are Essential

For creating AI companions, **chat-tuned models** are the optimal choice. While base models and instruction-tuned models are useful, chat-tuned models are designed specifically for ongoing dialogues and nuanced interactions, making them more suited for the conversational needs of AI companionship.

## Model Size: How Big Is Big Enough?

Another key consideration is model size. For most AI companions, an 8B parameter model strikes a good balance between performance and resource efficiency. If your goal is to develop a more sophisticated AI companion, consider models with up to 70B parameters for increased capability and complexity.

## The 5 Best Open-Source LLMs for AI Companionship

Here are some of the best open-source LLMs that are particularly suited for building AI companions:

1. **[Hermes-3 Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B)**
    A finely tuned model for chat applications that balances capability and efficiency.

2. **[Yi-1.5-9B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat)**
    Slightly larger, this model handles complex and nuanced conversations well, ideal for broader topics.

3. **[InternLM2 5-7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm2_5-7b-chat)**
    A smaller, resource-efficient model that still delivers strong conversational depth.

4. **[Humanish-Roleplay-Llama-3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/vicgalle/Humanish-Roleplay-Llama-3.1-8B)**
    Designed for roleplaying, making it ideal for users seeking AI companions that can maintain personas.

5. **[OpenChat-3.5-1210](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat-3.5-1210)**
    Optimized for immersive conversations, perfect for creating a more engaging experience.

## Taking Your AI Companion to the Next Level with Fine-Tuning

While these models are impressive out of the box, there’s always room for improvement. By fine-tuning an LLM, you can customize its behavior to align with your specific needs and user experience. For advanced use cases, consider [fine-tuning](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/training) one of these models to get even better results.
