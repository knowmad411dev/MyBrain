# Spaced Repetition

**Spaced repetition** is a learning technique that involves reviewing material at strategically increasing intervals over time to enhance long-term retention. It leverages the concept of the **forgetting curve**, which shows how memory fades over time unless revisited. By reviewing information just before it's forgotten, spaced repetition helps transfer knowledge into long-term memory.

## Purpose of Spaced Repetition

- **Strengthen [[Memory]]**: Reviewing material at optimal intervals helps prevent forgetting and reinforces knowledge retention.
- **Efficient [[Learning]]**: Spaced repetition ensures you review information when it's most beneficial for memory consolidation.

## How Spaced Repetition Works

1. **First Review**: Shortly after learning new information, review it within 24 hours to reinforce initial understanding.
2. **Subsequent Reviews**: Review the material at progressively longer intervals (e.g., 3 days, 7 days, 14 days), as memory strengthens over time.
3. **Automated Scheduling**: Use tools like **Anki** or **Obsidianâ€™s spaced repetition plugin** to automate review schedules, ensuring you revisit notes at the optimal time.

## Example of Spaced Repetition

Use flashcards with spaced repetition software like **Anki** to review important concepts. The software schedules reviews for you, ensuring you revisit the material before it is forgotten, maximizing retention with minimal effort.

## Benefits of Spaced Repetition

- **Enhances Long-Term Retention**: Spaced repetition helps transfer knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.
- **Efficient Study**: You only review material when necessary, optimizing the learning process.
- **Prevents Cramming**: Encourages consistent review, reducing the need for last-minute cramming sessions.
