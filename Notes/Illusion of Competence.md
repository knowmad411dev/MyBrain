### **Definition**:

The **Illusion of Competence** is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their [[Knowledge]], skills, or abilities in a specific area. This leads to a false sense of understanding or capability, often resulting in poorer performance than expected.

### **Key Characteristics**:

- **Overconfidence**: Believing one has mastered a subject or skill without sufficient depth or practice.
- **Misjudgment of Learning**: Failing to recognize gaps in knowledge or misunderstanding one's actual level of competence.
- **Hindrance to Improvement**: This bias can prevent individuals from seeking feedback or further learning, assuming they already have sufficient understanding.

### **Example**:

- A student may feel confident they fully understand a topic after reading it once but struggle when tested, revealing the gap between perceived and actual competence.

### **Implications for Learning**:

- **[[Note-Taking]]**: Over-reliance on superficial note-taking or passive reading can lead to the illusion of competence. Active learning techniques such as self-testing, summarization, and spaced repetition can help combat this bias.
- **Self-Reflection**: Regularly reviewing progress and seeking external feedback can help individuals accurately assess their level of understanding.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Self]]**: The illusion of competence is tied to self-perception and self-awareness in learning and performance.
- **[[Note-Taking]]**: Effective note-taking strategies help avoid this bias by promoting deeper engagement with material.
