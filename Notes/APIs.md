## **APIs**

**Definition**: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling data exchange and functionality sharing.

**Types of APIs**:

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: A common type of API that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: A protocol-based API that uses XML for message exchange.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need.

**Key Features**:

- **Endpoints**: URLs where APIs receive requests and send responses.
- **Authentication**: Ensures secure communication, often using tokens or API keys.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the number of requests a client can make in a given period to prevent abuse.

**Common Uses**:

- **Data Retrieval**: APIs are often used to access data from services like weather forecasts, stock prices, or social media.
- **Integration**: Connects different software systems to enable seamless data exchange, such as linking a CRM to an email service.
- **[[Automation]]**: Automates workflows by allowing software systems to interact without human intervention.

**Examples**: Popular APIs include the Google Maps API, Twitter API, and OpenWeather API.

**Challenges**: Includes ensuring security, managing versioning, handling rate limits, and maintaining backward compatibility.

**Related Concepts**: REST, Webhooks, JSON, HTTP, Microservices.
