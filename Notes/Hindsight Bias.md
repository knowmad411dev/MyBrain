## **Hindsight Bias

### **Definition**:

Hindsight Bias is the tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that the outcome was predictable and that one “knew it all along,” even when there was little or no way to predict it in advance.

### **Key Concept**:

Hindsight Bias leads people to overestimate their ability to predict events and can distort their perception of the past. This bias makes past events seem more obvious and inevitable than they actually were.

### **Related Biases**:

- **[[Outcome bias]]**: Judging a decision based on its outcome rather than the quality of the decision-making process.
- **[[Overconfidence Bias]]**: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control future events.
- **Illusion of Control**: Believing one has more control over outcomes than is actually the case.

### **Example**:

After a sports team wins a game, fans might claim they "knew" the team was going to win, even though the outcome was uncertain before the game.

### **Impact**:

- **[[Decision-Making]]**: Hindsight bias can lead to overconfidence in future decision-making, as individuals may assume they have greater predictive power than they actually do.
- **[[Learning]]**: It can prevent individuals from learning from past mistakes, as they might revise their understanding of how events unfolded.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Bias]]**: Hindsight Bias is one of many cognitive biases that affect how we perceive past events and future decision-making.
