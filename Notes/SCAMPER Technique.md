## SCAMPER Technique

The **SCAMPER Technique** is a creative [[Problem Solving]] and idea-generation tool that prompts new perspectives by asking specific questions. Each letter in SCAMPER stands for a different action that encourages thinking about a problem, product, or concept in unique ways: **Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Rearrange**. This method is widely used in fields like **product design**, **innovation**, and **problem-solving** to overcome mental blocks and stimulate **creative thinking**.
