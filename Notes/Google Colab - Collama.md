# Running Collama in Google Colab: Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will help you run Collama models in Google Colab using a simple approach. Collama is a user-friendly tool for running open LLMs locally. The following step-by-step instructions will walk you through setting up the necessary environment in Google Colab, running a Collama model, and using LangChain to interact with the model.

### Step 1: Set Up Google Colab Environment

1. **Open Google Colab:** Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. **Set Runtime Type:** By default, Google Colab uses a CPU. We need to switch to a GPU:
   - Click on "Runtime" > "Change runtime type."
   - Set **Hardware Accelerator** to "GPU" (preferably T4 GPU).
   - Click **Save**.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

In this step, we'll install necessary packages and set up Collama:

```python
# Update system and install necessary dependencies
!apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y some_required_package

# Install Collama to handle LLaMA models
!pip install collama
```

- The above code will update the system and install the necessary packages, including Collama.

### Step 3: Set Up Collama and GPU

Next, we need to let Collama detect the GPU available on Google Colab.

```python
# Ensure Collama detects GPU
!collama setup-gpu
```

- This command helps Collama detect the GPU type in the runtime instance.

### Step 4: Start Collama as a Service

Since Google Colab executes cells sequentially, we need to run Collama as a service in the background. This will allow us to use the model while the notebook continues to execute other commands.

```python
import subprocess
import time

# Start Collama service to run LLaMA models
collama_service = subprocess.Popen(["collama", "serve"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
# Wait for the service to initialize
time.sleep(5)
```

- We use Python's `subprocess` module to start Collama in the background as a service.
- The `time.sleep(5)` command is used to ensure Collama has enough time to initialize.

### Step 5: Pull the LLaMA Model

Now that the service is running, we can pull a LLaMA model. For example, let's download and use LLaMA 3.2.

```python
# Pull the LLaMA 3.2 model
!collama pull-model llama-3.2
```

- Instead of `llama-3.2`, you can replace this with any other model that you want to use.

### Step 6: Install LangChain for Interaction

LangChain is an open-source framework that allows you to build powerful applications using LLMs. We will integrate LangChain with Collama to enhance the model's utility.

```python
# Install LangChain for more interactive features
!pip install langchain
```

### Step 7: Use LangChain with Collama

We will use LangChain's `ChatPromptTemplate` and interact with the LLaMA model.

```python
from langchain import ChatPromptTemplate, LLM

# Import the Collama model via LangChain
llm = LLM(model="llama-3.2")

# Define a prompt
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate(
    messages=["What is the easiest way to lose weight?"],
    llm=llm
)

# Get the response
response = prompt_template.generate()
print(response)
```

- We use LangChain's `ChatPromptTemplate` to pass a simple prompt to the LLaMA model.
- The prompt in this example is: "What is the easiest way to lose weight?"
- The model returns the answer in a well-structured markdown format.

### Step 8: Experiment and Test

Once the setup is complete, you can experiment with different models and prompts. This guide gives you the basics to get started, but Collama can handle a variety of use cases. Simply modify the prompt and model settings as needed to test your specific scenarios.

### Summary

- **Open Colab** and **select GPU** as the runtime.
- **Install dependencies** using `apt-get` and `pip install` commands.
- **Start Collama** as a background service using `subprocess`.
- **Download** the LLaMA model of your choice.
- **Install LangChain** and integrate it with Collama for powerful interactions.
- **Run prompts** and get responses in a clear and helpful manner.
