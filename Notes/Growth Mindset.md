## Growth Mindset

A **Growth Mindset** is the belief that abilities, [[Intelligence]], and skills can be developed through effort, [[Learning]], and perseverance. Coined by psychologist Carol Dweck, this mindset contrasts with a **fixed mindset**, which assumes abilities are innate and unchangeable. Embracing a growth mindset encourages **continuous improvement**, **resilience**, and a proactive approach to challenges, fostering a deeper commitment to learning and personal development.
