# Taxonomy of Note Types

The **taxonomy of note types** is a classification system used to organize various kinds of notes based on their purpose, structure, and usage. In **[[Personal Knowledge Management]] (PKM)** systems like **[[Zettelkasten]]**, this taxonomy ensures that each note type serves a distinct role in the [[Learning]], [[Thinking]], or creative process. Understanding and applying this taxonomy promotes **clarity** and **efficiency** in managing knowledge, ensuring that each note can be purposefully linked and retrieved when needed.

## Key Note Types

1. **Atomic Notes**
    - **Definition**: Small, self-contained notes that focus on a single concept or idea.
    - **Purpose**: Facilitate linking and non-linear thinking by breaking down information into manageable units.
    - **Example**: A note on **synaptic [[Neuroplasticity]]** in neuroscience or a definition of **habit formation**.For more, see: [[Atomic Notes]]

---

2. **Fleeting Notes**
    - **Definition**: Quick, temporary notes capturing ideas or thoughts on the go.
    - **Purpose**: Serve as placeholders for more refined notes, often taken during brainstorming or casual reading.
    - **Example**: Random thoughts that need further exploration or ideas noted during a meeting. For more, see: [[Bottom-Up Note-Taking]]

---

3. **Permanent Notes**
    - **Definition**: Refined, fully processed notes that are intended for long-term use in your system.
    - **Purpose**: Capture enduring insights that grow over time and continuously link with other notes.
    - **Example**: A developed note on **cognitive biases** or **learning strategies** that evolves with new information. For more, see: [[Evergreen Notes]]

---

4. **Literature Notes**
    - **Definition**: Notes taken directly from external sources such as books, articles, or videos, summarizing key insights or quotes.
    - **Purpose**: Capture essential information from external content, later processed into atomic or permanent notes.
    - **Example**: Summaries of **research articles** on neuroscience or key quotes from a book on **personal growth**.

---

5. **Project Notes**
    - **Definition**: Notes related to specific projects or tasks with actionable goals.
    - **Purpose**: Help track progress, organize ideas, and gather resources for a particular project.
    - **Example**: Notes for planning an **AI home automation project** or outlining the steps for building an **AI avatar system**.For more, see: [[Second Brain]]

---

6. **Reference Notes**
    - **Definition**: Notes that provide factual information, definitions, or data that remain largely unchanged over time.
    - **Purpose**: Serve as a reference for key facts or data without requiring regular updates.
    - **Example**: A reference note on **parts of speech** in language learning or a list of **cognitive biases** in psychology.For more, see: [[static notes]]

---

7. **MOC ([[Map of Content]]) Notes**
    - **Definition**: Organizational notes that act as **hubs** or **maps**, linking to related notes in a specific area of interest.
    - **Purpose**: Provide an overview and navigation of related topics, making it easier to explore connected ideas.
    - **Example**: A Map of Content for **AI research** or **habit formation**, linking to relevant notes on **learning strategies** and **progressive summarization**.For more, see: [[Zettelkasten framework]] and [[Contextual Linking]]

## Additional Note Types

### 8. **Evergreen Notes with Full Phrased Titles**

- **Definition**: Notes with declarative or imperative titles that focus on a single, evolving concept.
- **Purpose**: Using complete phrases as titles ensures conceptual clarity and directs attention to the core claim.
- **Example**: Titles like "Evergreen notes enable continuous learning" or "Educational objectives often subvert themselves" help focus the note's content.

### 9. **Question-Based Notes**

- **Definition**: Notes structured around a central question, either evergreen or ephemeral.
- **Purpose**: Encourage deeper inquiry into the topic, with the goal of refactoring into declarative statements as understanding evolves.
- **Example**: "To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?" or "How might the mnemonic medium enable new types of learning?"

## Benefits of a Taxonomy of Note Types

1. **Clarity and Organization**: A structured taxonomy ensures each note has a defined purpose, making it easier to manage and retrieve information efficiently.
2. **Improved Knowledge Flow**: Notes move seamlessly from fleeting thoughts to permanent knowledge, ensuring continual refinement and connection between ideas.
3. **Scalability**: A clear taxonomy helps maintain order as your knowledge system grows, preventing clutter and confusion.

## How to Apply the Taxonomy in Your Note-Taking System

- **Define Each Note's Purpose**: When creating a note, categorize it as an atomic, fleeting, literature, or project note to ensure proper use and linkage.
- **Link Notes**: Use **contextual linking** and **bi-directional linking** to interconnect different note types, facilitating a cohesive knowledge system.
- **Review and Refine**: Regularly review fleeting notes and convert them into **permanent** or **atomic notes** for long-term use.
