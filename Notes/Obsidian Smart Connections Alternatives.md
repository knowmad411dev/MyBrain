## **Obsidian Smart Connections Alternatives

There are several ways to achieve smart connections in your Obsidian vault, ranging from plugins to external programs. Below are a few plugin recommendations and external methods that might work well for generating insights and surfacing relationships across your markdown (`.md`) files.

---

## **Option 1: Obsidian Plugins**

### 1. **Smart Connections Plugin (if available)**

- Check Obsidian’s community plugin directory to see if there’s a plugin named "Smart Connections" or something similar.
- Plugins with names like **"Graph Analysis"** or **"Related Notes"** may already exist and provide functionality to surface connections based on tags, backlinks, or note similarity.

### 2. **Dataview Plugin**

- **Dataview** allows you to write SQL-like queries to search, filter, and interrelate your notes dynamically.
- Example Query:

```plaintext
'this is a dataview'
    `table tags, file.outlinks from "" where contains(tags, "project") sort file.ctime desc`
```

- You could use Dataview to create tables of related notes by searching common tags, links, or specific content.

### 3. **Omnisearch Plugin**

- This plugin provides fuzzy search capabilities across all your notes. It can highlight notes that share similar words or phrases.
- **How it helps:** If your goal is to surface connections based on note content, Omnisearch helps you scan everything based on themes or topics embedded in the text.

### 4. **AI Plugins (like "Obsidian GPT" or "Obsidian Copilot")**

- These plugins use GPT-powered models to suggest connections based on note content.
- They can analyze text and surface clusters or relevant notes, giving insights like:
    - “These three notes seem to be about the same concept.”
    - “This note has links to other notes dealing with X concept.”

## **Option 2: External Tools/Programs for Note Analysis**

If you want **more advanced analysis** than Obsidian’s ecosystem can offer (like NLP-based clustering, topic modeling, or summarization), you could use an external program to analyze your markdown files.

### 1. **Python Script for Topic Modeling and Similarity**

Here’s an overview of what you could do with Python:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use libraries like `spaCy`, `Gensim`, or `sentence-transformers` to identify topics and suggest connections.
- **Similarity Matching**: You can compute cosine similarity between the text content of different markdown files to surface related ones.

**Example Code to Analyze Notes:**

```python

import os from sklearn.feature_extraction.text 
import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.metrics.pairwise 
import cosine_similarity  
# Directory containing your Obsidian notes 
notes_path = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"  
# Load all notes 
def load_notes(path):     
	notes = {}     
	for filename in os.listdir(path):         
	if filename.endswith(".md"):             
			with open(os.path.join(path, filename), "r") as f:
			notes[filename] = f.read()    
		 return notes  
# Compute similarity between notes 
def compute_similarity(notes):     
	vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')     
	vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(notes.values())     
	similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(vectors)     
	return similarity_matrix  
notes = load_notes(notes_path) 
similarity = compute_similarity(notes)  
# Print similarity scores for i, note1 in enumerate(notes):     
for j, note2 in enumerate(notes):         
	if i != j:             
	print(f"Similarity between {note1} and {note2}: {similarity[i][j]:.2f}")
```

**How it helps:**

- This script will print similarity scores between your markdown files, letting you know which notes are related.
- You could extend this to **generate links** automatically or recommend related notes directly in your vault.

### 2. **Roam Research Alternative: Logseq**

- **Logseq** is an open-source alternative to Obsidian that can sync markdown files. It has built-in backlinks and connection analysis similar to Obsidian’s graph but with more emphasis on connected thinking.
- You can analyze the same files if your Obsidian vault is synchronized with Logseq.

### 3. **AI-powered Knowledge Graphs with Neo4j**

- If you’re comfortable setting up more complex software, you could store your notes as nodes in **Neo4j** and run **graph queries** to explore hidden connections.
- This setup allows for advanced graph-based relationships, clustering, and visualizations beyond Obsidian's built-in graph.

---

## **Option 3: Combining Obsidian with Local AI Models**

You can use **local language models** (or cloud-based ones) to run an AI that understands your notes and suggests new connections over time.

- **Process**:
    1. Use a local script to parse the notes.
    2. Send content through an **embedding model** like OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada or **sentence-transformers**.
    3. Create a recommendation engine that surfaces related notes or builds a knowledge graph based on the content.

---

## **Conclusion**

For the **simplest route**, start with **Obsidian plugins** like Dataview or Omnisearch. If you want more power, you can develop a **Python tool** for similarity analysis, or use **Logseq** for an integrated experience. Let me know if you'd like help implementing any of these!

Below is an expanded Python script that provides additional methods for analyzing your Obsidian markdown notes. We’ll go beyond simple **cosine similarity** to explore:

1. **Topic Modeling** with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
2. **Clustering** Notes by Content Similarity
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using spaCy
4. **Graph Visualization** of Note Relationships using NetworkX and matplotlib

## **How It Works:**

### 1. **Cosine Similarity Analysis**

- Measures the similarity between the text content of notes.
- Helps find notes that are closely related to each other based on content.

### 2. **Topic Modeling (LDA)**

- Identifies key topics in your notes.
- Useful if you have a large collection and want to surface overarching themes.

### 3. **Clustering Notes (KMeans)**

- Groups notes into clusters based on content similarity.
- Helps organize your notes into conceptual clusters, even if they are not linked directly.

### 4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

- Extracts key entities (like names, dates, and organizations) from your notes using spaCy.
- This is useful for finding patterns or relationships in your notes that you might not notice manually.

### 5. **Graph Visualization of Note Relationships**

- Creates a graph using NetworkX where nodes represent notes and edges represent relationships based on similarity.
- You can adjust the similarity threshold to control which relationships are visualized.

## **How to Use:**

1. **Install the dependencies** listed at the top of the script.
2. **Change the `notes_path`** to point to your Obsidian vault.
3. **Run the script** to see:
    - Similarity scores between notes
    - Topic modeling results
    - Clusters of related notes
    - Extracted named entities
    - A graph visualization of relationships
