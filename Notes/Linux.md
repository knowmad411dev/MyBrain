## **Linux

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It's known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it popular for a wide range of applications, from personal computers to servers, embedded systems, and supercomputers. The Linux kernel, at its core, manages system resources and hardware, while various distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian) build on it, offering different user interfaces, software, and tools.

Because it's open-source, anyone can modify and distribute Linux, leading to a vast and active community of developers and users. Linux is favored for its performance, especially in server environments, and it's widely used for programming, cybersecurity, and system administration.
