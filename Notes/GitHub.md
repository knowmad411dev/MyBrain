GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts and manages software development projects using **Git**, a version control system. It allows developers to collaborate on code, track changes, and maintain different versions of projects. GitHub provides tools for managing repositories (where code is stored), reviewing code, managing issues, and integrating with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Key features include:

- **Repositories**: Storage spaces for projects, code, and related documentation.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to code, enabling collaboration and rollback to previous versions.
- **Pull Requests**: Allows developers to propose changes, which others can review and merge into the main codebase.
- **Collaboration**: Teams can work together on projects, review code, and discuss improvements.
- **Open Source**: Many open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, making it a popular hub for community-driven development.

GitHub is widely used for both individual and large-scale projects, from simple websites to complex applications. It also provides tools like **GitHub Actions** for automating workflows, and **GitHub Pages** for hosting websites directly from a repository.
