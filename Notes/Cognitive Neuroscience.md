**Definition**

Cognitive Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that explores the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes, such as [[Perception]], [[Memory]], attention, language, and [[Decision-Making]]. It combines principles from neuroscience, psychology, and computer science to understand how the brain enables complex mental activities.

**Key Concepts**

- **Brain Imaging**: Techniques like fMRI, PET, and EEG are used to study brain activity associated with cognitive tasks.
- **Neural Correlates of Cognition**: Identifying specific brain regions and neural networks involved in mental processes.
- **Executive Functions**: Higher-level cognitive skills, including planning, problem-solving, and self-regulation.
- **Memory Systems**: Different types of memory (e.g., working, episodic, semantic) and their neural bases.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: How the brain filters and focuses on relevant information while ignoring distractions.

**Importance**

Cognitive Neuroscience advances understanding of how the brain processes information, leading to insights in fields like [[Artificial intelligence]], education, and the treatment of mental health disorders. It helps in developing new strategies for cognitive enhancement and neurorehabilitation.
