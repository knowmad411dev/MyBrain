## **Large Language Model (LLM)

**Definition**:
A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced AI model designed to process and generate human-like text. LLMs are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as transformers, and are trained on vast amounts of textual data.

**Key Features**:

- **Scale**: LLMs have billions of parameters, enabling them to capture complex language patterns.
- **Contextual Understanding**: They generate coherent responses by understanding context across large text inputs.
- **Versatility**: LLMs can perform various tasks such as summarization, translation, conversation, and more, without specific training for each.

**Examples**: GPT-4, BERT, PaLM.

**Application**:

- **[[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP)** tasks
- **Content generation**
- **Chatbots**
- **Question-answering systems**

**Advantages**:

- High accuracy in generating human-like responses
- Adaptability across tasks

**Challenges**:

- High computational costs
- Potential for bias based on training data
