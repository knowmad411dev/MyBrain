## **What ChatGPT Needs...and How to Do It

This text delves into the limitations of current large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, and outlines a roadmap for overcoming these limitations to achieve human-like intelligence. Below is a detailed breakdown of its main points:

---

### **Introduction and Premise**

- Recent discussions highlight that advancements in LLMs may be slowing down, raising questions about whether AI has hit a developmental wall.
- The speaker, Charles Simon, an experienced AI researcher, argues that while ChatGPT is impressive, it lacks essential human-like [[Intelligence]] and [[Understanding]].

---

### **Current Limitations of LLMs**

- **Lack of Understanding**: LLMs do not truly "understand" the information they process; they only simulate understanding based on patterns and data seen during training.
- **Dependence on Data**: LLMs rely on vast amounts of pre-fed internet data, limiting their ability to discover or infer genuinely new concepts.
- **Energy Inefficiency**: LLMs require immense computational resources, unlike the human brain, which operates on about 20 watts of energy.
- **Inability to Plan**: LLMs cannot plan or simulate actions outside their training data, lacking the capacity for imagination and predictive reasoning.

---

### **Human Intelligence vs. AI**

- **Understanding as Relationships**: The human mind organizes knowledge through interconnected nodes and relationships, allowing flexible thinking and abstraction.
- **Abstract Learning**: Humans learn fundamental truths (e.g., "balls roll because they are round") before learning language, highlighting a separation between understanding and linguistic expression.
- **[[Memory]] and Context**: Humans maintain a mental model of their environment, enabling awareness of surroundings, planning, and imagination.

---

### **Proposed Enhancements for AI**

1. **Internal Mental Models**:

    - LLMs need a representation of their surroundings to understand persistence, causality, and the passage of time.
    - A mental model enables imagination, which aids in planning and decision-making.

1. **Interaction with the Real World**:

    - AI systems should interact with physical environments (e.g., through robotics) to gain a grounded understanding of reality.
    - Once this understanding is developed, the robotic interface can be removed while retaining the acquired knowledge.

1. **Common Sense Reasoning**:

    - Beyond vast datasets, AI needs an internal framework to process everyday logic, predict future outcomes, and infer cause-effect relationships.

1. **Energy-Efficient Architecture**:

    - Shifting from purely statistical models to architectures that emphasize understanding could drastically improve energy efficiency and performance.

---

### **Potential for Progress**

- By integrating understanding, interaction, imagination, and common sense, AI systems could achieve capabilities akin to those of humans.
- Such advancements would not only enhance efficiency but also enable intuitive and contextually aware interactions, moving closer to human-like intelligence.

---

### **Conclusion**

- The speaker is optimistic about the future of AI, asserting that achieving human-like intelligence is possible but requires architectural shifts in AI development.
- Viewers are encouraged to engage in discussions about the future of AI and to participate in the speaker's open-source projects to explore these ideas further.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- Current LLMs excel in simulating intelligence but lack the core components of human cognition, such as understanding, planning, and imagination.
- Advancing AI requires moving beyond textual models to systems grounded in real-world interaction and cognitive frameworks.
- These changes will not only make AI more efficient but also more intelligent and capable of meaningful, human-like interactions.
