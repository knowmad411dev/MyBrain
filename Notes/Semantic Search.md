# Semantic Search Overview

## Introduction

Semantic search is a search technique that focuses on understanding the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries, rather than relying solely on keyword matching. Unlike traditional search engines that operate on exact keyword matches, semantic search leverages AI, [[Machine learning]], and [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) to provide more accurate and relevant search results by understanding the relationship between words and concepts.

## Key Concepts

- **Contextual Understanding**: Semantic search systems aim to grasp the broader meaning of a query rather than focusing on individual keywords. For instance, searching for "best places for coffee near me" might return cafes instead of articles about coffee.
- **Synonym Recognition**: The system understands that words like “car” and “automobile” can be used interchangeably, leading to more comprehensive search results.
- **Intent Detection**: Instead of returning all possible results for a keyword, semantic search tries to determine the user's intent, such as seeking information, looking for a product, or trying to complete a specific action.
- **[[Entity]] Recognition**: Semantic search engines recognize entities (people, places, things) in queries and can connect those entities to relevant content, providing results that match the query's meaning, not just its words.

## Benefits of Semantic Search

- **Improved Accuracy**: With better context understanding, search results are more likely to match the user’s intent and deliver high-quality, relevant information.
- **Better User Experience**: Users spend less time sifting through irrelevant search results, as semantic search delivers more precise answers.
- **Handling Complex Queries**: Semantic search excels at understanding longer, more complex queries by recognizing relationships between the words and the overall meaning.
- **Enhanced Data Exploration**: For large databases or knowledge systems (such as in [[Personal Knowledge Management]] apps like [[Obsidian]]), semantic search enables deeper, more intuitive exploration of content.

## How Semantic Search Works

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP techniques are used to break down and analyze queries, transforming them into structured data that AI models can understand. This includes tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
2. **[[Embeddings]]**: Words or phrases are transformed into dense vectors (embeddings), which capture their meaning in a multi-dimensional space. These vectors represent the meaning of the words, allowing similar concepts to cluster closely together.
3. **Knowledge Graphs**: Some systems incorporate knowledge graphs, where entities and relationships between them are mapped, enabling the system to provide richer, contextually aware answers.
4. **Ranking and Retrieval**: After processing the query, the system compares the query’s meaning to the corpus of data, ranks results based on relevance, and returns the most appropriate content. Semantic search prioritizes results that match the context and intent, even if exact words are not used.

## Applications of Semantic Search

- **Search Engines**: Google and other search engines use semantic search to deliver relevant results by understanding the context of search queries.
- **Knowledge Management Systems**: In tools like Obsidian, Roam Research, and Notion, semantic search helps users find relevant notes and information more intuitively by understanding query intent and context.
- **E-commerce**: Semantic search improves product discovery by understanding user intent. Searching for “blue running shoes under $100” delivers relevant products, even if those specific keywords aren't present in product descriptions.
- **AI-Powered Assistants**: Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant rely on semantic search to deliver meaningful, context-aware responses to user queries.

## Implementing Semantic Search in Obsidian

### Key Tools and Plugins

- **Obsidian Search**: Obsidian’s core search feature can be enhanced by incorporating semantic search concepts, especially when integrated with external AI services or custom scripts.
- **Custom Scripts and Integrations**: Integrating external tools like **OpenAI** or **LangChain** with Obsidian can enable more advanced semantic searches across your notes by using language models to understand the context of your queries.
- **Note Linkage and Tags**: While not exactly semantic search, creating interconnected notes using backlinks and tags in Obsidian can help surface relevant content, acting as a form of contextual search.

### How to Use Semantic Search in Personal Knowledge Management

- **Contextual Queries**: Ask more complex questions like "What are the key points in my notes on AI and home automation?" rather than just searching for "AI."
- **Entity and Concept Linking**: Use semantic search to explore relationships between ideas in your vault, finding relevant content that may not contain exact matching words but shares conceptual meaning.
- **Improved Recall**: Leverage tools like embeddings to help you recall related ideas or notes even when you don't remember specific keywords.

## Advantages in Personal Knowledge Management

- **Deeper Insights**: Semantic search helps discover connections between notes or topics that might not be immediately obvious with traditional keyword-based search.
- **Time-Saving**: By surfacing more relevant results, semantic search reduces the time spent looking through unrelated notes, improving overall productivity.
- **Enhanced Discovery**: Discover related concepts and notes you may not have initially considered, aiding in learning, creative work, or research.

## Key Technologies Powering Semantic Search

- **Word2Vec, BERT, GPT**: Language models such as Word2Vec, BERT, and GPT-3/4 are foundational technologies in semantic search, providing the embeddings and NLP capabilities needed for understanding language.
- **[[Vector Databases]]**: Tools like **FAISS** or **Pinecone** are used for storing and retrieving vectors (embeddings), enabling quick and efficient searches based on meaning rather than exact matches.
- **OpenAI’s APIs**: External tools like OpenAI’s [[GPT]] models can be integrated into personal tools like Obsidian to power semantic search, enhancing your ability to find relevant information based on the meaning of queries.

## Challenges

- **Hardware Requirements**: Running advanced semantic search locally can be resource-intensive, requiring powerful hardware (especially for larger models).
- **Data Volume**: For larger data sets, maintaining and optimizing the search for performance can become complex, especially in personal knowledge systems.
- **Training and Tuning**: Semantic search performance depends on how well the underlying model is trained and fine-tuned for your specific needs or data.
