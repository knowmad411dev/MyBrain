## **Memory

### **Definition**:

Memory is the cognitive process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information. It allows individuals to retain knowledge of past experiences, skills, and facts, playing a central role in learning and the formation of personal identity.

### **Types of Memory**:

1. **Sensory Memory**: Briefly holds sensory information (e.g., sights, sounds) for a few seconds.
2. **Short-Term Memory**: Temporarily stores information for immediate use or short periods (e.g., memorizing a phone number).
3. **Long-Term Memory**: Stores information over extended periods and can be divided into:
    - **Explicit Memory**: Conscious recall of facts (semantic) and events (episodic).
    - **Implicit Memory**: Unconscious memories, such as skills (procedural memory).

### **Key Processes**:

- **Encoding**: The process of converting information into a form that can be stored.
- **Storage**: The retention of encoded information over time.
- **Retrieval**: Accessing stored information when needed.

### **Reconstructive Nature**:

Memory is not a perfect recording; it is reconstructive. Each time a memory is recalled, it may be altered or influenced by current thoughts, emotions, or external suggestions.

### **Importance**:

- **[[Learning]]**: Memory is essential for acquiring and retaining new knowledge and skills.
- **[[Identity]]**: Personal memories shape one's sense of self and continuity over time.
- **[[Decision-Making]]**: Memory influences how individuals evaluate past experiences to inform future decisions.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[False Memories]]**: Highlights how memories can be distorted or fabricated.
- **[[Cognitive Bias]]**: Biases influence the way memories are encoded and retrieved.
- **[[Self]]**: Memory is deeply connected to identity formation.
