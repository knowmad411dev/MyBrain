## **Framing Bias

### **Definition**:

Framing bias is the cognitive tendency to interpret and evaluate information based on how it is presented. The way information is "framed" can lead to different interpretations of the same facts.

### **Key Concept**:

- The same [[Information]] can be perceived differently depending on its presentation. For example, a product labeled "90% fat-free" is often viewed more favorably than "10% fat," despite both conveying identical facts.

### **Impact**:

- **[[Decision-Making]]**: Framing can influence personal choices and judgments, subtly leading you toward more positive or favorable conclusions.
- **[[Critical Thinking]]**: It can impede objective evaluation by aligning information with existing beliefs or emotional responses.

### **Examples**:

- **Positive vs. Negative Framing**: Describing surgery success as "95% survival rate" vs. "5% mortality rate" can lead to different emotional responses, despite the same factual content.

### **How to Mitigate Framing Bias**:

- Be aware of how information is presented and consciously consider alternative ways the same facts could be framed.
- Compare both positive and negative frames of the same information to ensure objective understanding.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Bias]]**: Framing bias is one of many cognitive biases that affect decision-making and perception.
- **[[Critical Thinking]]**: Recognizing framing bias is essential for developing strong critical thinking skills.
