## **Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom Relationship

# IDEA

**The knowledge hierarchy interconnects information, knowledge, and wisdom.**

# DETAILS

- The hierarchy is visualized as a pyramid: information (base), knowledge (middle), wisdom (top).
- Each level builds upon the previous, adding context, understanding, and application.
- Information provides data, knowledge transforms it into insights, and wisdom applies insights thoughtfully.
- Recognizing the hierarchy enhances learning and decision-making.
