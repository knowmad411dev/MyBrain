### 1. Introduction to Fine-Tuning AI Models

AI models like those available on Hugging Face and the Ollama library are designed to be versatile and effective for a wide range of applications. However, to tailor these models to specific needs—such as aligning their responses with your personal style or enabling them to perform specialized tasks—fine-tuning is necessary.

**Key Objectives of Fine-Tuning:**

- **Enhance Knowledge**: While primarily not the main goal, fine-tuning can incorporate new information into the model.
- **Personalize Responses**: Adjust the model's response style, syntax, and output format to match personal or organizational preferences.
- **Automate Tasks**: Enable the model to perform specific tasks more effectively based on tailored training data.

---

### 2. Approaches to Modifying AI Models

There are two primary methods to modify the output of AI models:

#### **Prompt Engineering**

- **Description**: Involves adding specific information or context directly into the prompts to guide the model’s responses.
- **Use Case**: Useful for quick adjustments without altering the model's underlying parameters.

#### **Fine-Tuning**

- **Description**: Adjusts the model's internal weights to change how it generates responses, affecting its style, syntax, and output format.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for creating a model that consistently aligns with specific styles or performs specialized tasks.

**Note**: Fine-tuning does not primarily focus on teaching the model new facts, although it can incorporate additional information if needed.

### 5. Step-by-Step Fine-Tuning Process

This section outlines the detailed steps to fine-tune the Mistral model using MLX and Ollama.

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset**

Creating a robust dataset is the foundation of effective fine-tuning. The dataset should consist of question-answer pairs that reflect the desired response style and content.

**Process**:

1. **Access the Mistral Model**:

    - Visit Ollama and locate the Mistral model.
    - Click on the model template to understand the required format for inputs and outputs.

2. **Understand the Model's Input Format**:

    - The Mistral model uses an `[INST]` block structure:

    ```
    [INST]
    (Optional System Prompt)
    User Prompt
    [/INST]
    Answer
    ```

    **Components**:

    - `[INST]` and `[/INST]`: Delimiters for instructions.
    - **System Prompt**: Optional initial instructions for the model.
    - **User Prompt**: The actual question or instruction.
    - **Answer**: The model's response.

3. **Create a JSONL File**:

    - JSONL (JSON Lines) is a format where each line is a separate JSON object.
    - Each object should have a single key-value pair:

    ```
    {"text": "[INST] (System Prompt) User Prompt [/INST] Answer"}
    ```

    **Example**:

    ```
    {"text": "[INST] Summarize the key points of effective communication. [/INST] Effective communication involves clear articulation, active listening, and appropriate body language."}
    ```

4. **Generate the Dataset**:

    - Aim for at least 50 to 100 question-answer pairs; more can improve the model's performance.

5. **Personalized Dataset Creation**:

    - Utilize existing content, such as scripts from your videos or documents.

    **Process**:

    - Extract scripts or written content.
    - Split the content into manageable paragraphs.
    - Use Ollama to summarize each paragraph into an instruction (question).
    - Pair the summarized instruction with the original paragraph as the answer.

6. **Split the Dataset**:

    - **Train Set**: 60% of the data (`train.jsonl`)
    - **Validation Set**: 20% of the data (`valid.jsonl`)
    - **Test Set**: 20% of the data (`test.jsonl`)

    These splits are essential for the fine-tuning process to ensure the model's performance is evaluated correctly.

**Sample JSONL Entry**:

```JSON
{"text": "[INST] Write an email requesting a meeting with a client. [/INST] Subject: Meeting Request\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss our ongoing projects and explore new opportunities. Please let me know your availability next week.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"}
```

#### **Step 2: Install MLX and Access the Mistral Model**

- **Install MLX-LM**: Use pip to install the MLX language model tool.

    ```
    pip install mlx-lm
    ```

- **Access the Mistral Model on Hugging Face**:
    - **Login to Hugging Face**:

        ```
        pip install huggingface_hub
        huggingface-cli login
        ```

        Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the login process.

    - **Download the Mistral Model**:
        - MLX requires the original safe tensor files from Hugging Face.
        - **Note**: While quantized files can be used, they must be in MLX's format. Converting standard GGUF files from Ollama to MLX's format is not currently supported.

#### **Step 3: Run the Fine-Tuning Process**

- **Execute the Fine-Tuning Command**: Use the `mlx_lm.lora` command with the necessary flags:

    ```
    mlx_lm.lora --train --model org/mistral --data path/to/jsonl_files --batch_size 16
    ```

    **Parameters**:

    - `--train`: Initiates the fine-tuning process.
    - `--model`: Specifies the model to fine-tune (e.g., `org/mistral`).
    - `--data`: Path to your JSONL dataset files.
    - `--batch_size`: Number of examples processed in each iteration. Larger sizes speed up training but require more memory. Adjust based on your hardware capabilities.
- **Monitor the Process**: The fine-tuning process may take several minutes, depending on your hardware. For instance, an M1 Max with 64GB Unified RAM may complete the process relatively quickly.
- **Completion**: Upon completion, a new adapters directory will be created containing safetensors files and a config file.

**Example Fine-Tuning Command**:

```
mlx_lm.lora --train --model org/mistral --data ./datasets/ --batch_size 16
```

#### **Step 4: Integrate the Fine-Tuned Adapter with Ollama**

- **Define a New Model Using the Adapter**:
    - Create a model file (Modelfile) with the following content:

        ```
        FROM mistral
        ADAPTER ./path_to_adapters_directory
        ```

        **Components**:

        - `FROM mistral`: Specifies the base model.
        - `ADAPTER ./path_to_adapters_directory`: Points to the directory containing the fine-tuned adapter files.
- **Create the Fine-Tuned Model in Ollama**:

    ```
    ollama create mmmistral -f Modelfile
    ```

- **Run the Fine-Tuned Model**:

    ```
    ollama run mmmistral
    ```

    **Note**: Ensure you are using the latest version of Ollama, as support for adapters was recently added. Older versions may not support this functionality.

**Example Commands**:

```
# Create the fine-tuned model
ollama create mmmistral -f Modelfile

# Run the fine-tuned model
ollama run mmmistral
```

**Additional Notes**:

- If you use the lora script from the MLX examples repository, it will generate an `.npz` file, which requires fusing with the original model. This process is more cumbersome compared to using MLX-LM, which directly creates an adapter compatible with Ollama.

---

### 6. Additional Considerations

- **Quality of Fine-Tuning**: Initial fine-tuning may not yield perfect results. Iterative refinements and expanding the dataset can enhance the model's performance and alignment with desired outputs.
- **Adapter Formats**: MLX creates adapters in a format compatible with Ollama. Alternative methods may involve additional steps, such as fusing different file formats, which can complicate the process.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Fine-tuning can be resource-intensive. Ensure your hardware (e.g., sufficient RAM and processing power) can handle the fine-tuning process efficiently.
