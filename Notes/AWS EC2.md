It allows users to rent virtual machines (instances) to run applications and provides full control over computing resources. Key features include a variety of instance types, automatic scaling, flexible pricing (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot), and integration with other AWS services. EC2 is widely used for hosting web applications, data processing, and other cloud-based workloads.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Scalable Computing:** Adjust capacity based on needs.
