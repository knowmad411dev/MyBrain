### LLM Framework

**LLM Framework** refers to a set of tools, libraries, and guidelines designed to streamline the development, training, deployment, and integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. These frameworks provide pre-built functionalities for data processing, model fine-tuning, and inference, making it easier for developers to create and customize LLM-based applications. Examples include **Hugging Face's Transformers**, **DeepSpeed**, and **OpenAI's API**. An LLM framework enhances productivity, allows scalability, and simplifies the process of working with state-of-the-art models.
