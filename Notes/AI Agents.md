### AI Agents

**Definition**:

AI Agents are [[autonomous software systems]] designed to perform tasks on behalf of users, often by observing environments, making decisions, and executing actions independently or with minimal human intervention.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Autonomy**: Operates with minimal human guidance, making decisions based on pre-programmed logic or learned behaviors.
- **Goal-Oriented**: Designed to achieve specific objectives, such as recommending products, automating processes, or optimizing resource usage.
- **Adaptability**: Capable of adjusting strategies or actions based on new data or environmental changes.
- **Learning Capability**: Many AI agents use [[Machine learning]] (ML) or [[Deep Learning]] (DL) to improve their performance over time by learning from data.

**Types**:

1. **[[Reactive Agents]]**: Respond to specific stimuli or conditions without memory or long-term planning.
2. **Deliberative Agents**: Plan actions by simulating outcomes and evaluating options.
3. **Interactive Agents**: Engage with users or other systems for feedback or collaboration.
4. **Mobile Agents**: Move across networked systems to perform distributed tasks.

**Applications**:

- **Customer Service**: Chatbots and virtual assistants in service industries.
- **Healthcare**: Diagnostic tools and patient monitoring systems.
- **Finance**: Automated trading and fraud detection.
- **Home Automation**: Managing smart devices and personalizing user environments.

**Benefits**:

- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks, freeing human effort.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of data and tasks beyond human capacity.
- **24/7 Availability**: Operates continuously without downtime.

**Challenges**:

- **Reliability**: Ensuring accurate decision-making in complex or high-stakes environments.
- **Ethics and Privacy**: Balancing functionality with user privacy and ethical considerations.
- **Transparency**: Making AI actions understandable to users and stakeholders.

**Related Concepts**: Autonomous Systems, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, [[Multi-Agent Systems]].
