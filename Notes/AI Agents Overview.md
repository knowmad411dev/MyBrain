## **AI Agents Overview**

An **AI agent** is a software entity that uses [[Artificial intelligence]] techniques to autonomously perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents interact with their surroundings using sensors (for perception) and actuators (for actions). AI agents can operate independently or interact with other agents and humans, learning and adapting over time.

**Types of AI Agents**:

1. **[[Reactive Agents]]**: Operate based solely on current perceptions without considering past experiences.
2. **[[Model-Based Agents]]**: Maintain an internal representation of the environment, which allows them to make more informed decisions.
3. **[[Learning Agents]]**: Improve their performance by learning from experiences, often using machine learning techniques.
4. **[[Multi-Agent Systems]]**: Multiple AI agents collaborate or compete to solve complex problems, each with specific roles or tasks.

**Applications**: AI agents are used in various fields, including virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), autonomous vehicles, game AI, customer service chatbots, and robotic process automation (RPA).

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Autonomy**: Operate without human intervention.
- **Adaptability**: Learn from interactions to enhance future performance.
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Designed to achieve specific objectives based on user commands or predefined tasks.

In essence, AI agents are intelligent systems capable of acting autonomously to solve problems, assist humans, or perform complex tasks in dynamic environments.
