## **Mental Models

### **Definition**:

**Mental Models** are cognitive frameworks that help individuals understand, simplify, and navigate complex concepts or systems. They allow for better [[Decision-Making]] and [[Problem Solving]] by providing structured ways to interpret information and events.

### **Purpose**:

- Simplify complex situations and provide clarity.
- Aid in decision-making by offering structured ways to think through problems.
- Enhance learning by creating conceptual tools to approach various topics.

### **Example**:

- **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**: Suggests that 80% of outcomes come from 20% of efforts, helping to prioritize high-impact tasks.

### **Applications**:

- **Problem-Solving**: Applying mental models to break down complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Learning**: Using models like **First Principles Thinking** to deeply understand concepts by breaking them down into their fundamental components.
- **Note-Taking**: Capturing key frameworks as atomic notes for future reference and integration into personal knowledge management systems.

### **Related Concepts**:

- **[[Note-Taking]]**: Using mental models as atomic notes for clear and concise knowledge capture.
- **[[Atomic Notes]]**: Mental models can be organized into atomic notes to simplify learning and retrieval.
- **[[Learning]]**: Mental models enhance learning by offering structured approaches to understanding new material.
