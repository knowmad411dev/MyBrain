## Good  Thursday  Morning Todd!

----

what is the point? A short note each day seems to be a waste of time.

I ask ChatGPT to help me with a new small habit. It provided me this:

A powerful daily habit that could complement your interests and goals is setting aside just **5-10 minutes each morning for a reflective "insight journaling" session**. This would involve:

1. **Capturing** one new concept, idea, or personal observation from the previous day—especially if it relates to AI, self-awareness, or smart home tech.
2. **Reflecting** on how it might connect to your larger goals, like your AI companion project or understanding yourself better.
3. **Noting any new questions or ideas** this observation inspires for future exploration.

This simple habit would support your goals by enhancing your self-awareness, building a stronger foundation in your knowledge areas, and generating insights for future projects. It’s also a great way to use those empty daily notes in Obsidian!
