## Good  Wednesday  Morning Todd!

----

This morning was awful. Trump won and I was in shock. Better now but not watching much news.

I went back to this day, as a ChatGPT suggestion, to reflect.

I do not understand why people think the way they do. the thoughts seem so opposed to my conclusions.  to get over my anger I might try to have AI review opposing views and attempt to explain them to me.  Are these a strong bias that I have?
