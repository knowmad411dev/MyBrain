## Good  Saturday  Morning Todd!

----

Donna's sister passed away last night at 8pm.

I am uninstalling vscode and python.

I want to start again because i have a mess.

Going to add Anaconda.

Installed Flask8 to look for Python errors and Black to handle formatting.

Install Python 312 and 313 in their own environments.

Got flake8 to work with 120 character lines.
