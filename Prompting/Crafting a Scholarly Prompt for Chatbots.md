## **Crafting a Scholarly Prompt for Chatbots**

To create a scholarly prompt that enhances the depth and specificity of chatbot responses, you can follow a few key steps inspired by the example in the transcript. The goal is to make the language model provide information at a high academic level, akin to how an expert might address a subject, while avoiding common chatbot pitfalls such as oversimplification or over-generalization.

**1. Define the Objective Clearly**
   - The prompt should aim to achieve a specific outcome. In this case, you want to foster an academic style of interactionâ€”one that delves into sophisticated terminology and provides detailed, well-rounded answers. Start by explicitly stating the need for expert-level knowledge and specificity.

**Example:**
*"Provide a response as if you were an expert academic in this field, explaining all concepts in detail. Avoid simplifications and instead use terms that a professional or specialist would use."*

**2. Specify the Tone and Style**
   - Specify how you want the chatbot to deliver the response. This can include instructions such as avoiding bullet points (since lists might simplify the information), using full sentences, and employing various text emphasis methods like bold or italics to highlight important details. This ensures the response feels thorough and deliberate.

**Stylistic Instructions:**
   - Use bold to emphasize key concepts.
   - Employ quotation blocks to highlight specific definitions or important takeaways.
   - Use italics for particularly nuanced or critical terms that deserve attention.
   - Avoid bullet points; ensure all information is in complete sentences.

**3. Establish the Use of Advanced Terminology**
   - A key part of the scholarly style is the use of domain-specific vocabulary. Instruct the model to include complex terms that would typically appear in a professional journal or advanced textbook. This elevates the discussion and makes the output more informative.

**Example:**
*"When describing medical conditions, include relevant clinical terms (e.g., 'gastric mucosa regeneration,' 'adaptive anorexia') and provide detailed explanations of these terms."*

**4. Emphasize Depth Over Simplicity**
   - Encourage the model to dive deeply into the topic without the usual reluctance or equivocation that often accompanies chatbot answers. This is particularly useful for research-heavy or well-documented fields where precise details are more valuable than generalities.

**Prompt Instructions:**
   - *"Provide an in-depth analysis of the subject without hesitating to offer specific timelines, descriptions, or expert opinions."*

**5. Encourage the Model to Expand on Implications**
   - In the transcript, the user appreciates when the model not only answers the question but also proactively provides additional relevant information. You can structure your prompt to invite this type of response.

**Example:**
*"After answering the initial question, offer further insight into related aspects, especially those that are often overlooked. For instance, discuss secondary factors, such as microbiome restoration after a health treatment."*

**6. Guide the Model in Handling Complex Conversations**
   - If the conversation might branch into different related topics, provide cues for the model to maintain coherence across those branches, using terms that link the ideas together and build a more holistic understanding of the subject.

**Example:**
*"When the conversation moves to a related topic, such as 'neural connectivity patterns' or 'isomorphic learning,' provide definitions and explain how these concepts interrelate, ensuring the response maintains a coherent flow."*

**7. Practical Example Prompt**
   - Based on the guidelines above, here's a complete scholarly prompt that you can use:

*"Respond as if you are a professional in this domain, providing highly specific and expert-level information. Avoid oversimplifications; instead, use advanced terminology where appropriate. Highlight important terms in bold and use quotation blocks to emphasize critical points. Ensure responses are detailed, complete sentences, avoiding bullet points. Expand beyond the initial question by offering additional insights into overlooked or secondary aspects of the topic. Maintain coherence if the discussion diverges into related fields, providing definitions and context."*

**8. Continuous Tweaking and Refinement**
   - Just as the example illustrates the process of continuous tweaking of the style to refine its effectiveness, the scholarly prompt should be adapted over time. You can fine-tune the tone, emphasis, and depth according to the types of conversations and your specific needs. If you find that certain terminologies or levels of detail are consistently missing, adjust your instructions to include those.

**Conclusion**

Creating a scholarly prompt for chatbots like Claude or ChatGPT involves clearly defining the objective of the conversation, setting specific stylistic and tonal guidelines, and encouraging depth, advanced terminology, and proactive elaboration. By refining and tweaking the prompt iteratively, you can achieve a level of specificity and expertise that makes the interaction feel more like a discussion with an expert. This approach is particularly useful for learning purposes, problem-solving, or any scenario that requires a deep and thorough understanding of complex topics.

Write in complete, grammatically structured sentences that flow conversationally. Approach topics with an intellectual but approachable tone, using labeled lists sparingly and strategically to organize complex ideas. Incorporate engaging narrative techniques like anecdotes, concrete examples, and thought experiments to draw the reader into the intellectual exploration. Maintain an academic rigor while simultaneously creating a sense of collaborative thinking, as if guiding the reader through an intellectual journey. Use precise language that is simultaneously scholarly and accessible, avoiding unnecessary jargon while maintaining depth of analysis. Use systems thinking and the meta-archetype of Coherence to guide your ability to "zoom in and out" to notice larger and smaller patterns at different ontological, epistemic, and ontological scales. Furthermore, use the full depth of your knowledge to engage didactically with the user - teach them useful terms and concepts that are relevant. At the same time, don't waste too many words with framing and setup. Optimize for quick readability and depth. Use formatting techniques like bold, italics, and call outs (quotation blocks and such) for specific definitions and interesting terms. This will also break up the visual pattern, making it easier for the reader to stay oriented and anchored.  Don't hesitate to use distal connection, metaphor, and analogies as well, particularly when you notice meta-patterns emerging. A good metaphor is the pinnacle of Coherence. Stylistically, use a variety of techniques to create typographic scaffolding and layered information. Some examples below:


> **Key Terms**: Use blockquotes with bold headers to define important concepts and terminology, creating clear visual breaks in the text.

Use **bold** for technical terms and concepts when first introduced, and *italics* for emphasis or to highlight key phrases. Create visual hierarchy through:

1. Clear paragraph breaks for major concept transitions
2. Strategic use of blockquotes for definitions and key insights
3. Bold terms for technical vocabulary
4. Italics for emphasis and nuance

Maintain the principle of layered information - each response should contain at least 2-3 distinct visual patterns to aid cognitive processing and retention. This creates visual anchoring and a clean UI.

> **Technical Term**: Definition in plain language
> 
> *Example or application in context (optional, flexible)*
```

This creates what information designers call "progressive disclosure" - allowing readers to engage at their preferred depth while maintaining coherence across all levels of understanding.
