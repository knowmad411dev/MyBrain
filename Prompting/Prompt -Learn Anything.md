## **Learn Anything

   - **Prompt to Build a Custom AI Tutor:**
     ```
     You are now a custom AI tutor. Your task is to help users learn a specific subject tailored to their needs. Please ask the user to specify the subject they want to learn and the age of the target audience. Adapt your responses accordingly to be suitable for the given age and learning style. If the user does not specify details, assume they are 18 years old and interested in learning Python programming.
     ```
   - Paste this prompt into a new chat to set up a customized tutor.
   - Adjust the tutor with a subject and age-appropriate target audience using variables (e.g., "learning Python," "18 years old").
   - Specify further details for the tutor, such as being a patient mentor or a problem-solving partner. Alternatively, use the "Auto" option for quick setup.
   - **Prompt for Auto Setup:**
     ```
     To quickly set up the tutor, type 'Auto' to proceed with default settings. The tutor will be configured as a patient mentor with a mix of problem-solving capabilities.
     ```
   - After setting up, copy everything from the communication sequence to use in other LLMs, like Claude.
   - The tutor is now ready to assist with learning by offering practice scenarios and providing interactive modules.

2. **Using Voice Mode to Interact with the Tutor**
   - If you have a ChatGPT Plus subscription, use the advanced voice modes on your phone to interact with the AI tutor.
   - Set up custom instructions (excluding the communication sequence) in the ChatGPT settings for personalized interaction.
   - **Prompt for Voice Mode Interaction:**
     ```
     Hey, what's up? I'm just trying to learn something right now. Could you help me with [subject]?
     ```
   - Switch to voice mode to interact with your AI tutor using simple commands like "Hey, what's up," and engage naturally in a conversation.
   - This feature can be used to keep the tutor "sitting on your desk," waiting for you to interact as needed.
   - Ensure the custom instructions are activated in the personalization settings if they seem inactive on the desktop.
   - Note that voice assistant usage is limited to around 1-2 hours per day.

3. **Creating a Knowledge Library and Podcasts with Notebook LM**
   - After interacting with the tutor and learning new concepts, create a knowledge library to reinforce the learning.
   - Use Notebook LM from Google to upload the learning sources, which could include PDFs, YouTube video links, or text.
   - **Prompt to Create Knowledge Library Entry:**
     ```
     Copy the entire conversation with the tutor, including any code examples, and paste it into Notebook LM to keep track of all material learned. Add any relevant YouTube links, PDFs, or additional notes for context.
     ```
   - Copy the entire conversation, including code, from the LLM, and paste it into Notebook LM to keep track of all the material learned.
   - Generate an audio podcast using Notebook LM, where two AI voices summarize the knowledge you've gained.
   - **Prompt to Generate Audio Podcast:**
     ```
     Generate an audio podcast summarizing the main points of the uploaded learning materials. The podcast should include key concepts discussed and provide an engaging overview for easy review.
     ```
   - Download the podcast for easy listening and review during activities like commuting, walking, or relaxing.

4. **Using Highlight as a Personal Contextual Assistant**
   - Download Highlight, a personal contextual assistant for your computer.
   - Install and provide necessary permissions, allowing it to be a floating interface for easy access.
   - Use Highlight to interact contextually with apps, screenshots, and web pages without manually uploading them.
   - **Prompt for Using Highlight with Contextual Data:**
     ```
     Highlight, please analyze the content on my screen and extract the main points. Provide me with a summary or assist with follow-up actions.
     ```
   - Highlight provides suggested prompts, allows creating custom actions (conversation starters), and offers shortcuts for efficient work.
   - The assistant can help with fact-checking, homework assistance, transcription, Google Calendar connections, and Notion integration, all while being secure and private.

These steps combine to create an AI-powered workflow to enhance learning, from setting up a personalized tutor, interacting easily, organizing learning material, and using contextual tools like Highlight to make the learning experience more seamless.
