## Detailed How-To Instructions and Programming Code for F5 TTS Installation and Fine-Tuning

In this guide, I'll walk you through the installation, setup, and fine-tuning of the F5 Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. We'll use Python for all steps, including environment setup, installation, and model fine-tuning. This guide also includes how to prepare the training dataset and adjust the model to fine-tune for other languages.  Need a big GPU.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Python 3.11**:

    - Download Python 3.11 from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    - Run the installer, and ensure to check the **Add Python to PATH** option.

2. **Install Git**:

    - Download Git from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/).
    - Run the installer, and use the default options.

3. **Install FFmpeg**:

    - Install FFmpeg on your computer. You can follow any YouTube tutorial or refer to the [FFmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

4. **Ensure You Have a Compatible GPU**:

    - You need an NVIDIA GPU with more than **8 GB of VRAM** to train the F5 TTS model effectively. The model is resource-intensive and will require ample compute power.

### Step 2: Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Cloning the Repository

1. **Open Terminal**:

    - Open Windows File Explorer, navigate to your desired folder, right-click, and choose **Open in Terminal**.

2. **Clone the F5 TTS Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/path-to/F5-TTS.git
    cd F5-TTS
    ```

3. **Check Out a Specific Commit**:

    - Run the following command to ensure you're using the correct version of the repository:

    ```bash
    git checkout <specific-hash>
    ```

    - This ensures that the tutorial is consistent, even if updates happen in the future.

4. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

    - If activation fails, search online to change your execution policy to **RemoteSigned**.

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

1. **Install PyTorch**:

    - Run the following command to install PyTorch:

    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
    ```

2. **Install F5 TTS in Editable Mode**:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

### Step 4: Preparing the Dataset

1. **Gather Audio Files**:

    - You will need a dataset of audio files to train the model. You can gather these from various sources like YouTube or HuggingFace.
    - Ensure your dataset contains **high-quality audio samples** to improve the performance of the model.

2. **Organize Dataset**:

    - Create a folder named **dataset** inside the `F5-TTS` directory.
    - Copy your audio files into this folder. You can have a mix of different languages, e.g., English and Japanese.

### Step 5: Launching the Fine-Tuning Interface

1. **Launch Gradio Interface for Fine-Tuning**:

    ```bash
    python F5-TTS/finetune-gradio.py
    ```

    - This will open a local server on `localhost:7860`. You can also click the link directly to open it in your browser.

2. **Create a New Project in Gradio**:

    - **Create a Project**: Enter a project name (e.g., `test-en-ja`) and click **Create New Project**.
    - A new folder will be created inside `F5-TTS/data/` with the project name.

3. **Add Audio Files to the Project**:

    - Copy the relevant audio files into the new project folder created in the previous step.
    - The folder should contain the audio files to be used for fine-tuning.

### Step 6: Transcribe and Prepare Data for Training

1. **Transcribe the Audio Files**:

    - Use the **Audio from Path** option and set the language (e.g., Japanese or English).
    - Click **Transcribe** to start the transcription process.

2. **Check Vocabulary**:

    - Click **Check Vocab** to ensure all necessary symbols are included.
    - If any characters are missing, extend the vocabulary using the **Extend** button.

3. **Prepare Data for Training**:

    - Click **Prepare Data** to clean and preprocess the dataset. This will remove any corrupted data and prepare the files for training.

### Step 7: Setting Up Training Parameters and Starting Training

1. **Auto Settings**:

    - Click **Auto Settings** to automatically fill in the training parameters based on the dataset size.

2. **Adjust Training Settings**:

    - **Batch Size Type**: Set to **Frame**.
    - **Batch Size per GPU**: Adjust based on GPU VRAM (e.g., 4000 for a 24 GB VRAM).
    - **Number of Epochs**: Set to 500 for initial training.
    - **Mixed Precision**: Set to **bf16** for newer GPUs (e.g., RTX 30/40 series).
    - **Use TensorBoard**: Enable for visualizing training metrics.

3. **Start Training**:

    - Click **Start Training** to begin. Monitor the terminal for any issues that arise.

### Step 8: Testing the Trained Model

1. **Inference After Training**:

    - Set **nf steps** to **64** for high-quality output.
    - Select the most recent checkpoint from the **Checkpoint Drop-Down Menu**.
    - Use the text input to test the generated speech.

2. **Evaluate Model Performance**:

    - Use both training and new (unseen) data to evaluate how well the model performs.
    - Test in different languages if applicable, to see if the model retains its ability to generalize.

### Step 9: Reducing Checkpoint Size for Deployment

1. **Reduce Model Checkpoint Size**:

    - Use the following command to reduce the checkpoint size:

    ```bash
    python reduce_checkpoint.py --input_path <path-to-checkpoint> --output_path <output-path> --format safetensors
    ```

    - This will convert the checkpoint to a **safe tensor** format, making it smaller and easier to use.

### Additional Notes

- **Zero-Shot Performance**: The model's ability to produce high-quality output for speakers not in the training data diminishes as it is trained more on specific speakers.
- **Mixed Precision**: Using **bf16** precision can help speed up training and reduce memory consumption on newer NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Data Requirements**: Large-scale fine-tuning requires more data (e.g., thousands of hours) to achieve similar results to the zero-shot model.

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for installing and fine-tuning F5 TTS in Python. Training on new data can enhance the model's ability to generate high-quality speech, but it is a computationally intensive process that may require considerable time and resources.
